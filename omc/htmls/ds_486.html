        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Pakistan. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 28 October 2014, Pakistan requested consultations  with respect to the imposition of provisional and definitive countervailing  measures by the European Union on imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate  from Pakistan, and with respect to certain aspects of the investigation  underlying these measures.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Pakistan claims that the measures appear to be  inconsistent with:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">Articles 1, 1.1(a)(1), 1.1(b), 3, 3.1(a), 10, 12.6,  12.8, 14, 14(b), 15.5, 19, 19.1, 19.3, 22.3, 22.4 and 32, and Annexes I, II,  III and VI, of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement; and<br />

        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 12 February 2015, Pakistan requested the  establishment of a panel. At  its meeting on 23&nbsp;February 2015, the DSB deferred the establishment of a  panel. </p>        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 25  March 2015, the DSB established a panel. China and the United  States reserved their third-party rights. Following the agreement of the parties, the panel  was composed on 13 May 2015.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 13 November 2015, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that the beginning of the panel's work was delayed as a result of a lack of available experienced lawyers in the Secretariat. The panel thus expected to issue its report before the end of 2016. On 10 December 2016, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that because the delay in the beginning of the panel's work, the panel expected to issue its final report to the parties by 1 June 2017.</p>

    	    <p><strong>Pakistan's claims regarding the  Manufacturing Bond Scheme</strong></p>
            <ol start="2">
                          <li>With respect to the  Manufacturing Bond Scheme (MBS), which the European Commission (the Commission)  found to be a countervailable subsidy contingent on export performance, Pakistan  claimed that the Commission acted inconsistently with Article 1.1(a)(1)(ii) of  the SCM Agreement, because it improperly determined the existence of a  financial contribution. The Panel found that the Commission acted  inconsistently with Article 1.1(a)(1)(ii) of the SCM Agreement by failing to  provide a reasoned and adequate explanation for why the entire amount of remitted  duties was &ldquo;in excess of those which have accrued&rdquo; within the meaning  of footnote 1 of the SCM Agreement.<br>&nbsp;
                          </li>
                          <li>Pakistan also claimed that the  Commission violated Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement, because &ndash; given its  incorrect interpretation and application of Article 1 &ndash; the Commission  incorrectly determined the existence of an export subsidy. The Panel found that  the Commission acted inconsistently with Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement by  improperly finding the existence of a &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; that was contingent  on export performance.<br>&nbsp;</li>
                          <li>The Panel found that it need  not address certain claims made by Pakistan under Annex I(i), Annex II(II),  Annex II(II)(1), Annex II(II)(2), Annex III(II), Annex III(II)(2), Annex  III(II)(3), Article 1.1(b), Article 10, Article 19 and Article 32 of the SCM  Agreement, and Article VI:3 of the GATT 1994. </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Pakistan's claims regarding the Long  Term Financing of Export-Oriented Projects (LTF-EOP)</strong></p>
            <ol start="5">
                          <li>With respect to the LTF-EOP,  which the Commission found to be a countervailable subsidy contingent on export  performance, Pakistan contended that the Commission violated Article 14(b) of  the SCM Agreement, because the Commission failed to properly calculate any  benefit as the difference between the amount that the firm receiving the loan  (Novatex) pays on the government loan and the amount the firm would pay on a  comparable commercial loan which the firm could actually obtain on the market.  The Panel found that the Commission acted inconsistently with Article 14(b) of  the SCM Agreement by failing to properly identify what Novatex would have paid  on a &ldquo;comparable commercial loan&rdquo; in calculating the benefit  conferred by the LTF-EOP Loan.<br>&nbsp; </li>
                          <li>Pakistan further contended that  the Commission acted inconsistently with its obligations under Article 1.1(b)  of the SCM Agreement by improperly analysing and determining the existence of  benefit. The Panel found that the Commission acted inconsistently with Article  1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement as a consequence of having acted inconsistently  with Article&nbsp;14(b) of the SCM Agreement.<br>&nbsp;</li>
                          <li>Pakistan also claimed that the  Commission acted inconsistently with the <em>chapeau</em> of Article 14 of the SCM Agreement, because the Commission failed to adequately  explain the application of the method used by the investigating authority in  calculating the benefit (which is provided for in the national legislation or  implementing regulations) to the particular case at hand. The Panel found that  the Commission acted inconsistently with the <em>chapeau</em> of Article&nbsp;14 of the SCM Agreement by failing to  transparently and adequately explain how it identified a &ldquo;comparable commercial  loan&rdquo;.<br>&nbsp; </li>
                          <li>The Panel exercised judicial  economy in respect of Pakistan's claims that as a result of violating Article  14(b) of the SCM Agreement and/or the <em>chapeau</em> of Article 14 of the SCM Agreement, the Commission acted inconsistently with  Articles 10, 19 and 32 of the SCM Agreement, and Article VI of the GATT 1994. </li>
              </ol>

            <p><strong>Pakistan's claims under Article 15.5  of the SCM Agreement</strong></p>
            <ol start="9">
                          <li>Pakistan argued that the  Commission's &ldquo;approach to causation&rdquo;, whereby the Commission made a  finding of the existence of a causal link between subject imports and the  injury to the domestic industry prior to the assessment of other known factors,  was inconsistent with Article 15.5 of the SCM Agreement. Further, Pakistan  claimed that the Commission failed to properly &ldquo;separate and  distinguish&rdquo; the effects of certain other known factors, i.e. imports from  Korea, the 2008 economic downturn, competition from non-cooperating EU  producers, and oil prices, from those of subject imports. The Panel found that  Pakistan failed to establish that the Commission's use of the &ldquo;break the  causal link&rdquo; methodology in this case was inconsistent with  Article&nbsp;15.5 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. The Panel found that the  Commission acted inconsistently with Article 15.5 of the SCM Agreement by  failing to conduct a proper non-attribution analysis in respect of competition  from non-cooperating EU producers and oil prices. It also found that Pakistan  failed to establish that the Commission's non-attribution analysis in respect  of imports from Korea and the economic downturn was inconsistent with Article  15.5 of the SCM Agreement. </li>
		  </ol>
            <p><strong>Pakistan's claims regarding  verification visits </strong></p>
            <ol start="10">
                          <li>Pakistan claimed that the  Commission acted inconsistently with Article 12.6 of the SCM Agreement by  failing to satisfy its obligation to disclose the results of the verification  visit to the exporting producer in Pakistan. The Panel upheld Pakistan's claim  and found that the Commission acted inconsistently with Article 12.6 of the SCM  Agreement because it failed to adequately provide the &ldquo;results&rdquo; of  the Novatex verification visit to Novatex.</li>

            <p class="paranormaltext">On 30 August 2017, the European Union notified  the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law  and legal interpretations in the panel report. On 4 September 2017, Pakistan notified the DSB  of its decision to cross-appeal.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">On 27 October 2017, the Appellate Body informed the DSB  that it would not be able to circulate the Appellate Body report in this appeal  by the end of the 60-day period, nor within the 90-day  time-frame provided for in Article 17.5 of the DSU. The Appellate Body referred  to the substantially enhanced workload it faced in 2017, the existence of several  appeals proceeding in parallel, and the increasing overlap in the composition  of the Divisions hearing the different appeals owing to the vacancies on the  Appellate Body. The Appellate Body also referred to the scheduling issues  arising from these circumstances, the number and complexity of the issues  raised in this and concurrent appellate proceedings, together with the demands  that these concurrent appeals place on the WTO Secretariat's translation  services, and the shortage of staff in the Appellate Body Secretariat. On  7&nbsp;May 2018, the Chair of the Appellate Body informed the&nbsp;Chair of the  DSB that the Appellate Body report in these proceedings would be circulated  no&nbsp;later than 16&nbsp;May 2018.</p>
                  <p class="paranormaltext" id="bkmk486abr"><a  name="bkmk486abr"></a>On 16  May 2018, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
    	      <p>On appeal,  the&nbsp;European Union claimed that the Panel's decision to make findings on  Pakistan's claims in this dispute, notwithstanding the expiry of the measure at  issue, was inconsistent with Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU, as informed by  Article&nbsp;3 of the DSU. Instead, the European&nbsp;Union argued that the  Panel should have dismissed the case in its entirety once the measure had  expired. In addition, in connection with the Panel's findings concerning the  MBS, the European&nbsp;Union appealed the Panel's interpretation of  Article&nbsp;1(1)(a)(1)(ii), footnote 1, and Annexes I to III to the  SCM&nbsp;Agreement that, in the context of duty drawback schemes, a subsidy  exists only when an &ldquo;excess&rdquo; remission occurs representing government  revenue foregone that is otherwise due. Pakistan challenged the Panel's  rejection of Pakistan's claim that the Commission's use of the &ldquo;break the  causal link&rdquo; approach in this case was inconsistent with Article&nbsp;15.5  of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. The remainder of the Panel's findings were not  appealed.</p>
    	      <p><strong>Expiry of the measure at issue</strong></p>
    	      <p>The Appellate Body  explained that panels have a margin of discretion in the exercise of their  inherent adjudicative powers under Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU. Within this  margin of discretion, it is for a panel to decide how it takes into account  subsequent modifications to, or expiry or repeal of, the measure at issue. The  fact that a measure has expired is not dispositive of the question of whether a  panel can address claims in respect of that measure. Rather, a panel, in the  exercise of its jurisdiction, has the authority to assess objectively whether  the &ldquo;matter&rdquo; before it, within the meaning of Article&nbsp;7.1 and  Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU, has been fully resolved or still requires to be  examined following the expiry of the measure at issue.</p>
    	      <p>From its  consideration of the arguments of the parties before the Panel, and the Panel's  reasoning, the Appellate Body considered it apparent that there still existed a  dispute between the parties on the &ldquo;applicability of and conformity with  the relevant covered agreements&rdquo;, within the meaning of Article&nbsp;11 of  the DSU, as regards the Commission's findings underpinning the measure at  issue, despite its expiry. Thus, for the Appellate Body, the Panel in this  dispute made an objective assessment that &ldquo;the matter&rdquo; before it  still required to be examined because the parties were still in disagreement as  to the &ldquo;applicability of and conformity with the relevant covered  agreements&rdquo; in respect of the Commission's findings underpinning the  expired measure at issue. </p>
    	      <p>The Appellate Body therefore  found that the European&nbsp;Union had not demonstrated that the Panel failed  to comply with its duty under  Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU, as informed by Article&nbsp;3 of the DSU, by  deciding to make findings on Pakistan's claims in this dispute, notwithstanding  the expiry of the measure at issue during the Panel proceedings. The  Appellate&nbsp;Body found that the expiry of the measure at issue did not mean  that the matter before the Panel had been fully resolved. The Appellate Body  therefore <strong>rejected</strong> the European&nbsp;Union's request that the Appellate  Body reversethe entirety of the  Panel&nbsp;Report and declare moot and of no legal effect the findings and  legal interpretations contained therein.</p>
    	      <p>In a separate opinion, one Appellate Body Member found that the Panel  failed to sufficiently assess whether the matter before it had been fully  resolved or still required to be examined following the expiry of the measure  at issue. </p>
    	      <p><strong>Government revenue foregone</strong></p>
    	    <p>The  Appellate Body considered that a  harmonious reading of Article&nbsp;1.1(a)(1)(ii), footnote&nbsp;1, and  Annexes&nbsp;I(i), II, and&nbsp;III to the SCM&nbsp;Agreement and the <em>Ad</em>&nbsp;Note to Article&nbsp;XVI of the  GATT&nbsp;1994 confirms that, in the context of duty drawback schemes, the  financial contribution element of the subsidy (i.e. the government revenue  foregone that is otherwise due) is limited to the <strong>excess</strong> remission or drawback of import charges on inputs and does  not encompass the entire amount of the remission or drawback of import charges. </p>
    	    <p> Accordingly,  the Appellate Body found that the European&nbsp;Union had not demonstrated that  the Panel erred in its interpretation of Article&nbsp;1.1(a)(1)(ii),  footnote&nbsp;1, and Annexes&nbsp;I(i), II, and III to the SCM&nbsp;Agreement  and the <em>Ad</em>&nbsp;Note to  Article&nbsp;XVI of the GATT&nbsp;1994</a>.</p>
    	    <p> The  Appellate Body noted that the European&nbsp;Union had not challenged the  Panel's review of the Commission's findings on the MBS, beyond the  European&nbsp;Union's claim that the Panel had applied the wrong legal standard  to the facts of this case. Accordingly, the Appellate Body found that the  European&nbsp;Union had not demonstrated that the Panel erred in its  application of Article&nbsp;1.1(a)(1)(ii) and footnote&nbsp;1 of the  SCM&nbsp;Agreement to the facts of this case. Consequently, the Appellate Body  upheld the Panel's finding that the Commission erred under  Article&nbsp;1.1(a)(1)(ii) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement by failing to provide a  reasoned and adequate explanation for why the entire amount of remitted duties  was &ldquo;in excess of those which have accrued&rdquo; within the meaning of  footnote&nbsp;1 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. The Appellate Body also upheld the  Panel's finding that the Commission acted inconsistently with  Article&nbsp;3.1(a) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement by improperly finding the  existence of a &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; that was contingent upon export performance. </p>
           
              <p><strong>The European&nbsp;Commission's causation analysis</strong></p>
            
            <p>The  Appellate&nbsp;Body observed that the key objective of a causation analysis  under Article&nbsp;15.5 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement is for an investigating  authority to establish whether there is a &ldquo;genuine and substantial  relationship of cause and effect&rdquo; between the subsidized imports and the  injury to the domestic industry. A showing of such a &ldquo;genuine and  substantial&rdquo; causal relationship entails: (i)&nbsp;an examination of the  existence and extent of the link between the subsidized imports and the injury  suffered by the domestic industry through an assessment of the  &ldquo;effects&rdquo; of the subsidized imports; and (ii)&nbsp;a non&#8209;attribution  analysis of the injurious effects of other known factors. The  Appellate&nbsp;Body thus held that an investigating authority is required under  Article&nbsp;15.5 to determine whether, in light of the injurious effects of  other known factors, the subsidized imports can be considered a &ldquo;genuine  and substantial&rdquo; cause of the injury suffered by the domestic industry.</p>
            <p> Turning  to the relevant findings by the Panel, the Appellate&nbsp;Body observed that  the Panel had correctly found that, while the Commission had stated that a  &ldquo;causal link&rdquo; existed between the subsidized imports and the injury  before it turned to its non&#8209;attribution analysis, such consideration of a  &ldquo;causal link&rdquo; was not a final conclusion, and it had not necessarily  prejudged the Commission's assessment of the effects of the other known  factors.</p>
            <p> The  Appellate&nbsp;Body considered that a careful reading of the Commission's  findings at issue revealed that, despite its unfortunate use of the &ldquo;break  the causal link&rdquo; terminology, the Commission had in fact examined whether  the subsidized imports could be considered as a &ldquo;genuine and  substantial&rdquo; cause of the injury to the domestic industry, while not  attributing the injuries caused by other known factors to subsidized imports,  in a manner consistent with the requirements of that provision. Accordingly,  the Appellate&nbsp;Body <strong>upheld</strong> the Panel's finding that Pakistan had  failed to establish that the Commission's approach to examining causation in  this case, including its non&#8209;attribution analysis, was inconsistent with  Article&nbsp;15.5 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. </p>
