        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the European Union </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 25 July 2011, the European  Union requested consultations  with China concerning the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties on x-ray  security inspection equipment from the European Union, pursuant  to China's Ministry of Commerce Notice  No. 1(2011), including its Annex.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The European Union claims that  the measure is inconsistent with various provisions of the Anti&#8209;Dumping  Agreement related to the process of the anti-dumping investigation (including  failure to provide access to relevant information and insufficient explanation  of the basis for the determinations) as well as the anti&#8209;dumping  determination at issue (absence of objective examination of the effect of the  dumped imports on prices in the domestic market and absence of objective  determination of causality).&nbsp; The  European Union considers that the measure is  inconsistent with Articles&nbsp;2.4, 3.1,  3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 6.1, 6.2. 6.4, 6.5, 6.9, 12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement,  and Articles VI:1 and VI:6(a) of the GATT 1994.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 8 December 2011, the European Union requested  the establishment of a panel.&nbsp; At its meeting on 19 December 2011, the DSB  deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 20  January 2012, the DSB established a panel. &nbsp;India,  Japan, Norway, Thailand and the  United States reserved their third party rights. Subsequently, Chile reserved its third party  rights. On 2 March 2012, the European Union requested the  Director-General to determine the composition of the panel. &nbsp;On 12 March 2012, the  Director-General composed the panel. On 4&nbsp;June&nbsp;2012, the  Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that the timetable adopted by the panel  after consultations with the parties envisaged that the  final report shall be issued to the parties by December&nbsp;2012.&nbsp; The panel expected to conclude its work within  that time-frame. On 17 October 2012, the Chairman of the panel  informed the DSB that due to unavoidable scheduling conflicts pertaining to two  panelists, the panel  expected to  conclude its work in January 2013.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext"><a name="bkmk425r" id="bkmk425r"></a>On 26  February 2013, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>This dispute concerned the imposition by China  of anti-dumping duties on imports of certain security inspection equipment  (x-ray scanners) from the European Union.&nbsp;  The European Union claimed that the anti-dumping duties imposed by China,  and the underlying investigation conducted by the Chinese authorities, were  inconsistent with various procedural and substantive provisions of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The European Union's claims with respect to MOFCOM's  price effects analysis</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The European Union claimed that MOFCOM's price  effects findings did not constitute an objective examination based on positive  evidence, contrary to the obligations under Articles 3.1 and&nbsp;3.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement.&nbsp; The basis for  the European Union's claim was that MOFCOM's price effects methodology was  flawed because it involved price comparisons, based on weighted average unit  values, in circumstances where MOFCOM did not take into account the  &ldquo;considerable differences&rdquo; among the products being compared,  particularly between &ldquo;high-energy&rdquo; and &ldquo;low-energy&rdquo;  scanners. According to the European  Union, the distorting effects of the  methodology followed by MOFCOM were exacerbated by the fact that during the POI  there were no exports of high-energy scanners from the European Union to China.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>The Panel upheld the European Union's claims  against MOFCOM's price effects analysis, on the basis that MOFCOM failed to  ensure that the prices it was comparing as a part of its price effects analysis  were actually comparable. In particular, the Panel concluded that MOFCOM's  price undercutting and price suppression analyses were inconsistent with  Articles 3.1 and 3.2 because they were not based on an objective examination of  positive evidence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The European Union's claims with respect to MOFCOM's  findings on the state of the domestic industry</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The European Union claimed that MOFCOM did not  base its injury finding on positive evidence, that MOFCOM's injury evaluation  did not involve an assessment of all relevant economic factors, and that  MOFCOM's injury analysis ignored the positive state of the domestic industry.  The European Union claimed that MOFCOM instead found material injury based on a  limited number of negative factors, ignoring the overall development and  interaction among the positive and negative factors. The European Union claimed  that, as a result, China violated Articles 3.1 and 3.4 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement.        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>The Panel rejected the European Union's claim  that MOFCOM did not rely upon positive evidence in making its determination, on  the basis that the European Union had not presented adequate evidence in this  regard. However, the Panel concluded that China acted inconsistently with  Articles 3.1 and 3.4 because MOFCOM failed to consider all relevant economic factors,  in particular, the &ldquo;magnitude of the margin of dumping&rdquo;.&nbsp; Further, the Panel found that MOFCOM's  examination of the state of the industry lacked objectivity, and was not always  reasoned and adequate.&nbsp; Finally, in the  light of its findings under Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement,  the Panel exercised judicial economy regarding whether MOFCOM acted  inconsistently with Article 3.4 by failing to take into account the differences  between high-energy and low-energy scanners.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The European Union's claims with respect to MOFCOM's  causation analysis</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The European Union claimed that MOFCOM  attributed the injurious state of the domestic industry to subject imports on  the basis of a flawed volume effects analysis and a flawed price effects  analysis.&nbsp; Further, the European Union  claimed that MOFCOM's non-attribution analysis was inconsistent with Articles  3.1 and 3.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because MOFCOM disregarded the actual  causes of any negative condition of the domestic industry.        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>The Panel concluded that MOFCOM acted  inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.5 due to the failure to take into  consideration the differences in the products under consideration in the price  effects analysis and due to the failure to provide a reasoned and adequate explanation  regarding how the prices of the dumped imports caused price suppression in the  domestic industry, particularly in&nbsp;2008.&nbsp;  The Panel exercised judicial economy with respect to MOFCOM's analysis  of the effect of the volume of subject imports.&nbsp;  Finally, the Panel concluded that MOFCOM failed to consider certain  &ldquo;known factors&rdquo;, and failed to consider evidence relating to other  factors that it did explicitly consider, in its non-attribution analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The European Union's claims with respect to the non-confidential  summaries</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The European Union challenged two aspects of  MOFCOM's treatment of non-confidential summaries.&nbsp; First, the European Union identified a number  of instances in which MOFCOM allegedly accepted non-confidential summaries  provided by Nuctech that were not adequate to permit a reasonable understanding  of the substance of the information submitted in confidence, contrary to the  first two sentences of Article 6.5.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.&nbsp; Second, the European Union claimed that MOFCOM  allowed the Public Security Bureau not to submit any non-confidential summaries  of confidential information, even though the conditions for application of the  &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; mechanism provided for in the third and  fourth sentences of Article 6.5.1 had not been fulfilled.&nbsp; The European Union also pursued dependent  claims under Articles 6.2 and 6.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>For the most part, the Panel upheld the European  Union's claims that the non-confidential summaries provided by Nuctech were not  adequate, contrary to the first sentence of Article 6.5.1. The Panel also  upheld the European Union's claim that MOFCOM had improperly invoked the  Article 6.5.1 exceptional circumstances mechanism by failing to require Nuctech  to provide a statement of reasons why the relevant confidential information  could not be summarized. The Panel exercised judicial economy in respect of the  European Union's dependent claims under Articles 6.2 and 6.4 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The European Union's claims with respect to the  disclosure of essential facts</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The European Union claimed that MOFCOM failed to  disclose certain essential facts to interested parties, contrary to Article 6.9  of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.&nbsp; The  European Union also pursued dependent claims under Articles 6.2 and 6.4.        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>For the most part, the Panel upheld the European  Union's claims under Article 6.9. In doing so, the Panel was guided by the  findings of the Appellate Body in China &mdash;  GOES, which were circulated during the Panel's proceedings. The Panel  exercised judicial economy in respect of one aspect of the European Union's  Article 6.9 claim, and in respect of its dependent claims under Articles 6.2  and 6.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The European Union's claims with respect to the contents  of the public notice issued by MOFCOM</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The European Union claimed that China violated  Article 12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because of alleged shortcomings in  the content of MOFCOM's public notice of affirmative determination providing  for the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties. The European Union made  two types of claims under Article 12.2.2.&nbsp;  First, in respect of the first sentence of Article 12.2.2, the European  Union claimed that MOFCOM failed to include in its public notice certain  relevant information on the matters of fact and law which led to the imposition  of final measures.&nbsp; Second, in respect of  the second sentence of Article 12.2.2, the European Union claimed that MOFCOM  failed to include in its public notice the reasons for rejecting relevant  arguments made by Smiths during the course of the investigation.        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>The Panel upheld certain aspects of the European  Union's claims under both the first and second sentences of Article 12.2.2, but  rejected other aspects thereof.</li>
        </ul>

<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 24 April 2013, the DSB adopted the  panel report.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">At the DSB meeting on 24 May 2013, China said that  it intended to implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings in a manner that  respects its WTO obligations and that it will require a reasonable period of  time to do so. On 19 July 2013, China and the European Union informed  the DSB that they have agreed that the reasonable period of time to implement  the DSB's recommendations and rulings shall be 9&nbsp;months and 25 days.&nbsp; Accordingly, the reasonable period of time  expired on 19 February 2014.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">At the DSB meeting on 26 February 2014, China said  that its Ministry of Commerce had published a notice and launched a  re-investigation on the X-ray security inspection equipment from the European  Union and that the  anti-dumping duty at issue was terminated.&nbsp;  Thus, it had fully complied with the DSB recommendations and rulings.</p></div>
