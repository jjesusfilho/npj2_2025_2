        <h3>Consultations</h3>
         <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Japan</strong></p>
        <p align="left">On 11 June 2021, Japan requested consultations with  China with respect to measures imposing anti-dumping duties on stainless steel  billets, hot-rolled coils, and hot-rolled plates from Japan.</p>
        <p align="left"> Japan claimed that these measures appear to be  inconsistent with: </p>
         <ul>
           <li>Articles 1,  3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 6.5, 6.5.1, 6.9, 12.2, and 12.2.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement; and<br>
&nbsp;           </li>
           <li>Article VI  of the GATT 1994.</li>
         </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and  Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p align="left">
          On 19 August 2021, Japan  requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 30 August 2021, the  DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
<p class="paranormaltext">At  its meeting on 27 September 2021, the DSB established a panel. Australia,  Brazil, Canada, the European Union, India, Korea, Mexico, the Russian  Federation, Saudi Arabia, Chinese Taipei, the United States, and Viet Nam  reserved their third-party rights.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 13  January 2022, Japan  requested the Director-General to compose the panel. On 24 January 2022, the  Director-General composed the panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On  27 June 2022, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that, due to the  complexity and magnitude of the dispute and  the need to ensure that the parties had  sufficient time to prepare and present their cases, particularly given the  challenges caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic,  the panel expected to issue its final report to the parties by  the first quarter of 2023. The  Chair of the panel apprised the DSB that the report would be available to the  public once it was circulated to the Members in all three official languages,  and that the date of circulation depends on completion of translation. On  17 March 2023, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that the panel expected  to issue its final report to the parties in May 2023.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On  11 April 2023, Japan and China informed the  DSB that they had agreed to Procedures for  Arbitration under Article 25 of the DSU  in this dispute. Such procedures were entered into by Japan and China  to give effect to communication JOB/DSB/1/Add.12 (&ldquo;Multi-Party  Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement Pursuant To Article 25 Of The DSU  (MPIA)&rdquo;) and with the objective of setting a framework for  an Arbitrator to decide on any appeal of any final panel report issued in this  dispute, should  the Appellate Body not be able  to hear such an appeal under Articles 16.4 and 17 of the DSU.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="bkmk601r" name="bkmk601r"></a>On 19  June 2023, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
    	    <p>The  following summarizes the main findings of the panel: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The panel found that Japan established that  MOFCOM's determination of the domestic industry was inconsistent with Article  4.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because MOFCOM failed to provide a reasoned  and adequate explanation of its finding that the production of the firms  included in the domestic industry represented a &ldquo;major proportion&rdquo; of  the total production of all Chinese producers. </li>
              <li>The panel found that Japan did not establish  that MOFCOM's definition of the domestic industry was inconsistent with Article  4.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement due to certain alleged discrepancies in data  MOFCOM relied on, and due to the alleged lack of representativeness of the  domestic industry. The panel did not consider it necessary to make findings in  relation to Japan's consequential claim under Article 3.1 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement. </li>

              <li>The panel found that Japan did not establish  that MOFCOM acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.3 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement in finding that a cumulative assessment of the effects of the subject  imports was appropriate in light of the conditions of competition between the  imported products and the conditions of competition between the imported  products and the like domestic product. The panel, therefore, also found that  Japan did not establish that MOFCOM's price effects analysis, impact analysis  and causation findings were, respectively, inconsistent with Articles 3.2, 3.4,  and 3.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement as a consequence of MOFCOM's alleged  violation under Articles 3.1 and 3.3. </li>
              <li>The panel found that Japan established that  MOFCOM's consideration of price effects was inconsistent with Articles 3.1 and  3.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because the following aspects of MOFCOM's  consideration were not based on an objective examination of positive evidence. 
              <ul>
                <li>MOFCOM's findings with respect to the  comparability of prices of stainless steel billets (slabs), stainless steel  plates, and stainless steel coils; </li>
                <li>MOFCOM's price comparisons between imported and  domestic like products of various grades of steel; and </li>
                <li>MOFCOM's overall conclusion of price depression. </li>
              </ul></li>
              <li>The panel found that Japan established that  MOFCOM acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.4 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement in its examination of the following factors: domestic market share,  trends in sales prices, capacity utilization and ending inventory. The panel  also found that Japan did not establish that MOFCOM acted inconsistently with  Articles 3.1 and 3.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement when examining, in the  context of its impact analysis, the domestic industry's sales volume, apparent  domestic consumption, pre-tax profits, and return on investment. </li>
              <li>The panel found that Japan established that  MOFCOM's causation analysis was inconsistent with Articles 3.1 and 3.5 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement because: 
              <ul>
                <li>it relied upon MOFCOM's price effects and impact  analyses, which were inconsistent with Articles 3.1, 3.2, and 3.4 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement; and </li>
                <li>MOFCOM's non-attribution analysis in respect of  the increase in nickel prices since mid-2016 was not based on an objective  examination of positive evidence, and was not reasonably and adequately  explained. </li>
              </ul></li>
            <li>The panel found that Japan did not establish that MOFCOM's  non-attribution analysis in respect of the decrease in price of nickel from May  2014 to the end of 2015 and introduction of stricter environmental standards was  inconsistent with Articles 3.1 and 3.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </li>
              <li>The panel found that Japan did not establish  that MOFCOM acted inconsistently with Article 6.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement  when it accepted, by implication, that the good cause which the applicant  presented justified the redaction of the company names at the time it made its  application. The Panel also found that Japan had not established that the  non-confidential summary of the confidential information in the application was  inconsistent with Article 6.5.1. </li>
              <li>The panel found that Japan established that  MOFCOM acted inconsistently with Article 6.9 because it failed to disclose certain  essential facts under consideration that formed the basis for its price effects  analysis and its causation determination. The panel found that Japan did not  establish that MOFCOM acted inconsistently with Article 6.9 in relation to its  disclosure of the essential facts pertaining to the following: (a) cumulation  analysis, (b) examination of the state of domestic industry, (c) causation  determination in relation to cost of environment regulations, and (d)  definition of the domestic industry. </li>
              <li>The  panel rejected several claims under Articles 12.2 and 12.2.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement challenging different aspects of MOFCOM's public notice,  and found it unnecessary to address certain other claims under these  provisions. </li>
              <li>The panel did not find it necessary to make  findings on several claims raised by Japan in these proceedings. </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
      </div>
  </div>

<p>At its meeting on 28 July 2023, the DSB adopted the  panel report.</p>
<h3>Reasonable period of  time</h3>
<p>
  On 25 August 2023, China informed the DSB that it  intended to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in a manner  consistent with its WTO obligations and that it would need a reasonable period  of time to do so. On 27 October 2023, China and Japan informed the DSB that  they had agreed pursuant to Article 21.3(b) of the DSU, that the reasonable  period of time for China to implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings  would be 9 months and 10 days. Accordingly, the reasonable period of time was set  to expire on 8 May 2024.</p>
<p>On 27 May 2024, China and Japan informed the DSB of  Agreed Procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the  DSU (sequencing agreement). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Implementation of  adopted reports</h3>
<p>On 13 May 2024,  China informed the DSB pursuant to Article 21.6 of the DSU of its compliance  with the DSB's recommendations and rulings in this dispute. China explained  that on 9 November 2023, the Ministry of Commerce of China published Notice  (2023) No. 46 and launched a re-investigation on the stainless steel products  at issue, and that on 8 May 2024, the Ministry of Commerce of China published  Notice (2024) No. 19 announcing the determination of the re-investigation.  China submitted that through this re-investigation, it had fully implemented  the DSB's recommendations and rulings in this dispute. </p>
