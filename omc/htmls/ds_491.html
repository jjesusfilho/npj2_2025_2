        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Indonesia. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 13 March 2015, Indonesia requested consultations  with the United States concerning the imposition of anti-dumping and  countervailing measures on certain coated paper products from Indonesia, as  well as the investigation underlying those measures.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Indonesia claims that the measures are inconsistent  with:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">Articles 2.1, 2.1(c), 10, 12.7, 15.5, 15.7 and  15.8 of the SCM Agreement;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">Articles 3.5, 3.7 and 3.8 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement; and<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">Article VI of the GATT 1994.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 9 July 2015, Indonesia requested the  establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 20  July 2015, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. On 20 August 2015, Indonesia submitted a new  request for the establishment of a panel. At its  meeting on 31 August 2015, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>

      <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 28 September 2015, the DSB established a panel. Canada,  China, the European Union, Korea and Turkey reserved their third-party rights. </p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 25 January 2016,  Indonesia requested the Director-General to compose the panel. On  4&nbsp;February&nbsp;2016, the Director-General composed the panel.</p>

     </div>
      <div aria-labelledby="headingOne" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseA" role="tabpanel">
          <div class="panel-body">
                        <p>Indonesia challenged: (i) the anti-dumping and countervailing  measures imposed by the United States on imports of certain coated paper from Indonesia  following an investigation by the United States Department of Commerce (USDOC)  and the United States International Trade Commission (USITC); and (ii) a  provision of US law that deems a tie vote of the USITC Commissioners in injury  determinations to be an affirmative determination (&ldquo;tie vote&rdquo;  provision). </p>
          <p><strong>Terms of reference</strong></p>
                        <p>The United States requested that the Panel find that certain of Indonesia's  arguments in support of its claims under Articles 14(d), 2.1(c) and the chapeau  of Article 2.1 of the SCM Agreement with respect to a subsidy in the form of a  log export ban were tantamount to claims under provisions of the SCM Agreement (Articles  1.1(a) and 22.3) which were not included in Indonesia's panel request, and as a  consequence, that these arguments were outside the Panel's terms of reference. Particularly  as Indonesia had made clear that it was not making any claims under the provisions  at issue, the Panel found it neither necessary nor appropriate, for the purpose  of resolving the dispute, to make the specific findings requested by the United  States. Nevertheless, the Panel agreed that some of Indonesia's arguments  challenged aspects of the USDOC's determination of the existence of a financial  contribution despite having made no claim of violation under Article 1.1(a).  The Panel indicated that it would assess the relevance of these arguments in the  course of addressing Indonesia's claims.</p>
          <p><strong>Rejection of  in-country prices as benchmarks to calculate benefit </strong></p>
                        <p>Indonesia challenged as inconsistent with Article 14(d) of the SCM  Agreement the USDOC's benefit calculations regarding two forestry measures: the  provision of standing timber and the log export ban. In particular, Indonesia  challenged the USDOC's conclusions  that there were no market-determined stumpage fees or market prices for logs in  Indonesia that could have been used as a benchmark to calculate benefit and the  USDOC's decisions, as a result, to resort to out-of-country benchmarks. </p>
                        <p>With respect to the provision of standing timber, the Panel noted that  the USDOC based its conclusion that there were no market-determined stumpage  fees in Indonesia on the Government of Indonesia (GOI)'s predominant role in  the market for standing timber. In assessing the consistency with Article 14(d)  of this conclusion, the Panel found it relevant that in the context of its  benchmark analysis, the USDOC examined other&nbsp;  features of the market for standing timber in addition to the GOI's  predominance as a supplier of the good at issue. In addition, the Panel  concluded that there was no meaningful information concerning private prices  for stumpage before the USDOC. Considering these elements in light of the  circumstances of the case, in particular the characteristics of the market for  standing timber in Indonesia and the market share held by the GOI, the Panel  concluded that the USDOC did not err in concluding that there were no  market-determined in-country private prices for stumpage that could be used as  the benchmark. </p>
                        <p>Regarding the log export ban, the Panel noted that it was undisputed that the ban applied to all  logs produced in Indonesia; therefore, there logically remained no Indonesian  private log market unaffected by the financial contribution. The Panel  considered that this rendered domestic log prices unsuitable as a benchmark.  The Panel also considered that the USDOC did not err in concluding that import  prices for logs did not constitute an appropriate benchmark, particularly in  light of the fact that the log export ban applied to all logs in Indonesia and  that import quantities were minimal relative to domestic production. </p>
                        <p>The Panel therefore rejected Indonesia's claims under Article 14(d) of  the SCM Agreement.</p>
          <p><strong>Use of facts availabl</strong>e </p>
                        <p>Indonesia challenged as inconsistent with Article 12.7 of the SCM  Agreement the USDOC's finding that the GOI provided a subsidy to APP/SMG in the  form of debt forgiveness. Specifically, Indonesia challenged the USDOC's  finding, based on an adverse inference, that the buyer of the investigated  producer's debt was affiliated with that investigated producer. The Panel found  that the USDOC reasonably considered that the missing information was necessary  to complete the determination, and that the GOI had failed to provide necessary  information within a reasonable period and failed to act to the best of its  ability to cooperate in the investigation. Further, the Panel concluded that  there was a sufficiently close connection between the missing information and  the conclusion reached on the basis of an adverse inference &mdash; regarding the  question of affiliation between the buyer and the investigated producer &mdash; to  conclude that the &ldquo;facts available&rdquo; relied upon reasonably replaced  the missing information. The Panel therefore rejected Indonesia's claim under Article  12.7 of the SCM Agreement. </p>
          <p><strong>Specificity</strong></p>
                        <p>Indonesia challenged the USDOC's findings of <em>de facto</em> specificity with respect to the three subsidies at issue  on the ground that the USDOC failed to identify the relevant subsidy programme  in connection with each of these subsidies, contrary to Article 2.1(c) of the  SCM Agreement. The Panel rejected Indonesia's interpretation of Article 2.1(c)  as requiring, where a subsidy programme is manifested in the form of written  instruments, that both the financial contribution and the benefit be  discernible from such instruments. The Panel found that, with respect to each  of the subsidies at issue, the USDOC had identified the relevant subsidy  programme consistently with Article 2.1(c). </p>
                        <p>In addition, the Panel rejected Indonesia's claim that, in its  determination that the debt buy-back subsidy was <em>de facto</em> specific, the USDOC failed to identify the granting  authority, in contravention of the chapeau of Article 2.1 of the SCM Agreement.  The Panel considered that the USDOC had clearly identified the granting  authority providing the subsidy &mdash; an agency of the GOI &mdash; as well as the  jurisdiction of that authority.</p>
                        <p>The Panel therefore rejected Indonesia's claims under the Article  2.1(c) and the chapeau of Article 2.1 of the SCM Agreement. </p>
          <p><strong>Non-attribution </strong></p>
                        <p>Indonesia&nbsp; challenged as inconsistent with Articles 3.5  of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and 15.5 of the SCM Agreement the USITC's non-attribution  analysis with respect to three &ldquo;other factors&rdquo; it argued would injure  the domestic industry in the future at the same time as subject imports. As a  preliminary matter, the Panel rejected an argument of Indonesia that if a  domestic industry is found to be vulnerable to future injury for reasons other  than the effect of subject imports during the POI, then it cannot be found to  be threatened with injury by future subject imports. The Panel found that the  USITC's explanations and treatment of the first and second &ldquo;other factors&rdquo;  (projected decline in demand and the expiration of a tax credit) were  reasonable conclusions that could have been reached by an objective and  unbiased investigating authority. The Panel considered that Indonesia had  failed to make a <em>prima facie</em> case of  violation with respect to the third alleged &ldquo;other factor&rdquo; (&ldquo;non-subject  imports&rdquo;) given that Indonesia had not alleged that such imports were  threatening to cause injury to the domestic industry. For these reasons, the  Panel rejected Indonesia's claims.</p>
          <p><strong>Threat of injury</strong></p>
                        <p>Indonesia challenged as inconsistent with Articles&nbsp;3.7 of the  Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement and 15.7 of the SCM Agreement the USITC's threat of  injury determination as based on conjecture and remote possibility. Indonesia's  claims focused on two intermediate findings reached by the USITC, that subject  imports would gain market share at the expense of the domestic industry, and  that subject imports would have adverse price effects on domestic prices. The  Panel found that Indonesia had not demonstrated that the USITC based these  findings on  conjecture or remote possibility. The Panel therefore rejected  Indonesia's claims. </p>
          <p><strong>&ldquo;Special care&rdquo; in threat of injury cases</strong></p>
                        <p>Indonesia claimed that, contrary to  Article&nbsp;3.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and  Article 15.8 of the SCM Agreement, the USITC had failed to exercise &ldquo;special  care&rdquo; in its threat of injury determination. Indonesia argued that the  deficiencies it had identified in the context of its other claims against the  USITC's threat of injury determination also rendered this determination  inconsistent with Articles 3.8 and 15.8. The Panel rejected Indonesia's claims  on the basis that it had already found that Indonesia had failed to establish  its other claims and that Indonesia had not presented additional arguments in  support of its claims under Articles 3.8 and 15.8. The Panel also rejected, as  without support in the text of the Agreements, arguments by Indonesia to the  effect that the USITC had failed to exercise &ldquo;special care&rdquo; because  of the cumulative effect of the alleged deficiencies. </p>
          <p><strong>WTO-consistency of the us &ldquo;tie vote&rdquo;  provision</strong></p>
                        <p>Indonesia challenged Section 771(11)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930,  as amended, codified at Title 19 of the United States Code, Section 1677(11)(B)  as inconsistent &ldquo;as such&rdquo; with the &ldquo;special care  obligation&rdquo; under Article 3.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article 15.8  of the SCM Agreement. This &ldquo;tie vote&rdquo; provision deems an evenly split  vote by the USITC Commissioners on <em>inter  alia</em>, threat of injury, to be an affirmative injury determination. The  Panel considered that the &ldquo;special care&rdquo; requirement under Articles  3.8 and 15.8 applies to an investigating authority's consideration of the  substantive requirements for a determination of threat of injury and that the  Anti-Dumping and the SCM Agreements generally do not discipline Members' voting  procedures or the manner in which decisions to apply duties are made in  anti-dumping or countervailing duty investigations. Consequently, the Panel  rejected Indonesia's claim.</p>
