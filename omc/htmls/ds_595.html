        <h3>Consultations</h3>
         <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Turkey</strong></p>
        <p align="left">On 13 March 2020, Turkey requested consultations  with the European Union concerning the provisional and definitive safeguard  measures imposed by the European Union on imports of certain steel products and  the investigation that led to the imposition of those measures.</p>
        <p align="left">Turkey claimed that the measures appear to be  inconsistent with: </p>
         <ul>
           <li>Articles  2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1(b), 4.1(c), 4.2, 4.2(a), 4.2(b), 4.2(c), 5.1, 5.2, 6, 7.1,  7.4 and 9.1 of the Agreement on Safeguards; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
           <li>Articles  I:1, II:1(b), XIII:1, XIII:2 and XIX:1(a) of the GATT 1994.</li>
         </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p>On 16 July 2020, Turkey requested the establishment of a  panel. At its  meeting on 29 July 2020, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 28 August 2020, the  DSB established a panel. Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, Korea,  Norway, the Russian Federation, Switzerland, Chinese Taipei, Ukraine, the  United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States reserved their  third-party rights.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">Following  the agreement of the parties, the panel was composed on 29 September 2020.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On  12 March 2021, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that, taking into  account the working procedures and the timetable prepared in consultation with  the parties, the panel did not expect to issue its final report to the parties  before the second half of 2021. The Chair indicated that this was due to the  complexity and magnitude of the case and the need to ensure that the parties  had sufficient time to prepare and present their cases, particularly given the  challenges caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. &nbsp;The panel issued its final  report to the parties on 10 December 2021, and informed the parties that it  would circulate the report on 21 December 2021. On 20 December 2021, Turkey  asked the panel to suspend its work under Article 12.12 of the DSU. On 19 January,  9 February and 23 February&nbsp;2022 Turkey asked the panel to extend the  suspension of its work. The panel granted all of these requests.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 22 March 2022, the parties jointly  communicated to the panel and to the DSB that they had agreed on procedures for  arbitration under Article 25 of the DSU (WT/DS595/10). Through those agreed  procedures, the European Union and Turkey jointly requested the Panel to extend  indefinitely the suspension of its work pursuant to Article 12.12 of the DSU,  except to the extent necessary to effect certain joint requests of the parties.  The Panel granted that request. The European Union and Turkey also agreed that  if by 25 April 2022 neither party gave notice of recourse to arbitration  pursuant to those agreed procedures, the Panel should then resume its work.  Neither party gave notice of recourse to arbitration by that deadline.  Therefore, the Panel resumed its work and on 29 April 2022 it circulated its  final report.</p>

    	    <p>This  dispute concerns a provisional safeguard measure and a definitive safeguard measure  adopted by the European Union in 2018 and 2019, respectively, on imports of  certain steel products. </p>
            <p>The  European Union applied the measures on the grounds that three unforeseen  developments (increased global steel overcapacity, an increase in the use of  trade restrictive and trade defence measures on steel, and the US Section 232  measures on steel) had resulted in an increase in imports of certain steel  products into the EU market, and that the increase in imports was threatening  the EU industry with serious injury. The safeguard measures took the form of  duty-free tariff-rate quotas and 25% out-of-quota safeguard duties.</p>
            <p>Turkey  claimed that the provisional and definitive safeguard measures were  inconsistent with various provisions of the Agreement on Safeguards and the  GATT 1994.</p>
            <p><strong>Measures  under review</strong></p>
            <p>The Panel  declined to review the provisional safeguard measure, which was no longer in  force. The Panel reviewed the definitive safeguard measure, which had replaced  the provisional safeguard measure.</p>
            <p><strong>Product  scope</strong></p>
            <p>Turkey claimed that the definitive safeguard measure was  inconsistent with various provisions of the Agreement on Safeguards and the  GATT 1994 because according to Turkey the European Commission applied distinct  safeguard measures on 26 products but had not examined whether the  circumstances and conditions for imposing a safeguard measure existed for each  of those products individually and, moreover, because the European Commission had  adopted an internally inconsistent approach to product scope at different  stages of the investigation and application of the measures. The Panel rejected  Turkey's proposition that the European Commission had applied distinct  safeguard measures on 26 products. Instead, the Panel found that the European  Commission had applied a single safeguard measure on 26 product categories  taken together. The Panel concluded that Turkey did not establish any  inconsistencies in relation to the product scope of the European Commission's  analysis of the circumstances and conditions for imposing a safeguard measure. </p>
            <p><strong>Unforeseen  developments</strong></p>
            <p>Turkey claimed that the definitive safeguard measure was inconsistent  with Article&nbsp;XIX:1(a)&nbsp;of the&nbsp;GATT&nbsp;1994 because the European  Commission had made a number of errors in its assessment of whether increased  imports had resulted from unforeseen developments. Specifically, Turkey argued  that the European&nbsp;Commission: (a) had not identified unforeseen  developments; (b) if it had identified developments, they were not unforeseen;  and (c) it had not demonstrated that the injurious increase in imports had occurred  &ldquo;as a result of&rdquo; the unforeseen developments. The Panel rejected  Turkey's arguments that the European Commission had not identified unforeseen  developments and that any such developments were in any case not unforeseen.  However, the Panel accepted that the European Commission had not established  that the increase in imports had taken place &ldquo;as a result of&rdquo; the  unforeseen developments. Accordingly, the Panel found that the definitive  safeguard measure was inconsistent with Article&nbsp;XIX:1(a) in this regard.</p>
            <p><strong>Effect of obligations</strong></p>
            <p>Turkey claimed that the definitive safeguard measure was  inconsistent with Article&nbsp;XIX:1(a)&nbsp;of the&nbsp;GATT&nbsp;1994 because  the European Commission had not identified the relevant &ldquo;obligations incurred&rdquo;  under the GATT 1994, and had not explained how any such obligations had the  effect of constraining the European&nbsp;Union's&nbsp;ability to prevent the  threatened injury. The Panel agreed that the  European&nbsp;Commission had not identified in its published reports the obligations  whose effect resulted in the increase in imports, and accordingly found that the  definitive safeguard measure was inconsistent with Article&nbsp;XIX:1(a) in  this regard.</p>
            <p><strong>Increase in imports</strong></p>
            <p>Turkey claimed that the definitive safeguard measure was inconsistent  with Articles&nbsp;2.1 and 4.2(a) of the Agreement on Safeguards and Article&nbsp;XIX:1(a)  of the GATT 1994 because of alleged errors in the European Commission's finding  of an increase in imports. The Panel rejected Turkey's contention that  decreases in import volumes of certain product categories and families at the  end of the period of investigation invalidated the European Commission's  &ldquo;increase&rdquo; finding. The Panel also found that Turkey had not  substantiated its proposition that the &ldquo;increase&rdquo; was insufficient.  The Panel concluded that Turkey had not established any inconsistencies in  relation to the &ldquo;increase&rdquo; finding. </p>
            <p><strong>Threat of serious injury and causation</strong></p>
            <p>Turkey claimed that the European Commission's findings that  the domestic industry was under threat of serious injury, and that increased  imports caused such threat, were inconsistent with various provisions of the  Agreement on Safeguards and the GATT 1994. The Panel found that the European  Commission's finding of a threat of serious injury was not &ldquo;based on  facts&rdquo; as required by Article 4.1(b) of the Agreement on Safeguards. In  light of this finding, the Panel did not consider it necessary to examine the  other claims and arguments raised by Turkey in relation to the European  Commission's findings on threat of serious injury and causation.</p>
            <p><strong>The  extent and time necessary to prevent serious injury</strong></p>
            <p>Turkey claimed that the definitive safeguard measure was inconsistent  with Articles&nbsp;5.1 and 7.1 of the Agreement on Safeguards, and  Article&nbsp;XIX:1(a) of the GATT 1994, because it was applied beyond the  extent and time necessary to prevent serious injury. The Panel rejected  Turkey's contention that the European Commission had applied the definitive  safeguard measure beyond the extent necessary to prevent serious injury by not  taking into account data from the first six months of 2018 in determining the  size of the tariff rate quotas (TRQs). The Panel also found that Turkey had not  established that the double remedy regulation suspending the application of  certain anti-dumping and countervailing measures to the extent of their overlap  with the relevant safeguard duties had resulted in the application of the  safeguard measure beyond the extent necessary to prevent serious injury. The  Panel concluded that Turkey had not established any inconsistencies in relation  to the extent of the application of the safeguard measure. The Panel did not  consider it necessary to issue findings on Turkey's claims and arguments that  the definitive safeguard measure had been applied beyond the time necessary to  prevent serious injury. </p>
            <p><strong>The  allocation of shares in the Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs)</strong></p>
            <p>Turkey claimed that the definitive safeguard measure was inconsistent  with Article&nbsp;XIII:2(d) and the <em>chapeau</em> of Article&nbsp;XIII:2 of  the GATT 1994 because the TRQs adopted through the safeguard measure allocated  country&#8209;specific shares based on a period that was not representative, and  without taking due account of any special factors affecting the trade in the  product concerned. Turkey also claimed that the definitive safeguard measure was  inconsistent with Article 5.2(a) of the Agreement on Safeguards, &ldquo;for the  same reasons&rdquo;. The Panel rejected Turkey's&nbsp;contention that the period  based on which the European Union allocated country&#8209;specific shares in the  relevant TRQs did not qualify as a &ldquo;previous representative period&rdquo;  under Article XIII:2(d) because it did not include the first six months of 2018.  The Panel also rejected Turkey's alternative contention regarding the existence  of a special factor that the European&nbsp;Commission improperly failed to take  into account in allocating country&#8209;specific shares in TRQs for the relevant  product categories. Based on an arguendo assumption that Article 5.2(a) of the  Agreement on Safeguards applies to TRQs, the Panel also rejected Turkey's claim  under that provision. The Panel concluded that Turkey had not established any  inconsistencies in relation to the allocation of shares in the TRQs. </p>
            <p><strong>The pace  of liberalization and increased restrictiveness</strong></p>
            <p>Turkey  claimed that the definitive safeguard measure was inconsistent with Articles 5.1  and 7.4 of the Agreement on Safeguards because the first and second review  regulations made it more restrictive and reduced its pace of liberalization.  The Panel rejected Turkey's proposition that these provisions preclude a  reduction in the pace of liberalization relative to the initially announced  pace, and also found that Turkey had not demonstrated why the modified pace of  liberalization would not facilitate adjustment of the domestic industry in this  case. Further, the Panel found that Turkey had not established a <em>prima facie</em> case that the other modifications made through the first and the second review  regulations had made the safeguard measure more restrictive than originally  determined in a manner inconsistent with the Agreement on Safeguards. The Panel  concluded that Turkey had not established any inconsistencies in relation to  the pace of liberalization and increased restrictiveness of the safeguard  measure.</p>

<p>At its meeting on 31 May 2022, the DSB adopted the panel report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reasonable period of  time </h3>
<p> On 5 August  2022, T&uuml;rkiye and  the European Union informed  the DSB that they had agreed pursuant to  Article 21.3(b) of the DSU, that the  reasonable period of time for the European Union  to implement the DSB's recommendations  and rulings would be 7  months and 16 days. Accordingly,  the reasonable period of time was set to expire  on 16  January 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
