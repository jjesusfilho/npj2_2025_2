        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Canada. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 20   December 2002, Canada  requested consultations with the United States regarding the  investigation of the USITC in Softwood Lumber from Canada (Invs. Nos.  701-TA-414 and 731-TA-928 (Final)) and the final definitive anti-dumping and  countervailing duties applied as a result of the USITC&rsquo;s final determination  made on 2 May 2002, notice of which was published in the United States Federal  Register on 22 May 2002 (Volume 67, Number 99 at pp. 36022-36023) that an  industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of  imports of softwood lumber from Canada that the Department of Commerce has  determined are subsidized and sold in the United States at less than fair  value.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Canada claimed that, through these measures, the United  States has violated its obligations under Article VI:6(a) of the GATT 1994,  Articles 1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.7, 3.8, 12 and 18.1 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement and Articles 10, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.7, 15.8, 22 and  32.1 of the SCM Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 3   April 2003, Canada  requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 15 April 2003, the DSB deferred the  establishment of the panel. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Further to a second request by Canada, the DSB  established a panel at its meeting on 7 May 2003. The European Communities and Japan reserved  their third party rights. On 16   May 2003, Korea  reserved its third party rights. On 12 June 2003, Canada requested the  Director-General to compose the panel. On 19 June 2003, the Director-General composed  the panel. On 19 December   2003, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that it would not  be possible for the Panel to complete its work in six months in light of  scheduling conflicts. The panel expected to complete its work in February 2004.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 22   March 2004, the panel report was circulated to Members. The panel  found that, in its final threat of injury determination, the US International  Trade Commission (USITC) failed to comply with the requirements of Articles 3.5  and 3.7 the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article 15.5 and 15.7 of the SCM Agreement in finding a likely imminent  substantial increase in imports and a casual link between imports and threat of  injury to the domestic industry in the US producing softwood lumber. The panel  found that the USITC&rsquo;s finding of likelihood of substantially increased imports  was not consistent with the requirements of the Agreements, and that the  causation conclusion rested on this inconsistent finding. The panel therefore  found that the anti-dumping and countervailing measures imposed by the United States  on imports of softwood lumber from Canada are inconsistent with the United  States' obligations under those provisions, and recommended that those measures  be brought into conformity with the United States' obligations.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 26 April 2004, the DSB adopted the panel  report.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Compliance proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 14 February 2005, considering that the measures  allegedly taken by the United States to comply with the DSB&rsquo;s recommendations  and rulings were inconsistent with United States' obligations under relevant  WTO agreements, Canada requested the DSB to establish a panel under Article  21.5 of the DSU. In parallel, Canada requested on the same date the DSB's  authorization to suspend concessions or other obligations (see below).</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 23   February 2005, Canada  and the United States  notified the DSB of an Understanding regarding procedures under Articles 21 and  22 of the DSU, which provides that the Article 22.6 arbitration be suspended  until adoption by the DSB of the recommendations and rulings in the compliance  proceedings.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 25 February 2005, the DSB agreed to refer the  matter raised by Canada  to the original panel.&nbsp; On 2 March 2005, the compliance  panel was composed.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 25   May 2005, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that it would  not be possible&nbsp;for the panel to complete its work in 90 days in light of  scheduling conflicts, and that the panel expected to complete its work in  September 2005.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 15 November 2005, the compliance panel report was circulated  to Members.&nbsp; The compliance panel found that the determination of the  USITC implementing the panel and DSB recommendations in the original dispute was  not inconsistent with the United    States&rsquo; obligations under the Anti&#8209;Dumping  Agreement and the SCM Agreement. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 13   January 2006, Canada  notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues  of law covered in the compliance panel report and certain legal interpretations  developed by the compliance panel. On 10 March 2006, the Chairman of the Appellate Body informed  the DSB that the Appellate Body would not be able to circulate its report  within the 60-day period due to the time required for completion and  translation of the report, and that it estimated it would be circulated to  Members no later than 13   April 2006.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 13   April 2006, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members.  The Appellate Body clarified the standard of review to be followed by panels in  reviewing threat of injury determinations. The Appellate Body found that the  compliance panel had acted inconsistently with Article 11 of the DSU because it  articulated and applied an improper standard of review in its assessment of the  USITC's Section 129 determination. Consequently, the Appellate Body reversed  the compliance panel's findings that the USITC's determination was not  inconsistent with the obligations of the United States under Articles 3.5 or  3.7 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Articles 15.5 and 15.7 of the SCM Agreement.&nbsp;  It also reversed the compliance panel's finding that the United States  had implemented the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in the original  dispute. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> However, the Appellate Body was unable to complete the  analysis and determine whether the USITC's Section 129 determination was  consistent or inconsistent with the United States' obligations under Articles  3.5&nbsp;and 3.7 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Articles 15.5 and 15.7 of  the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 9   May 2006, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the  compliance panel report, as reversed by the Appellate Body report.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Proceedings under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 14 February 2005, simultaneous to requesting the  establishment of a compliance panel (see above), Canada requested the DSB to  authorize the suspension of concessions or other obligations with respect to  the United States under Article 22.2 of the DSU.&nbsp; On 23 February 2005 the United&nbsp;States requested this  matter to be referred to arbitration in accordance with Article 22.6 of the  DSU. At its meeting of 25   February 2005, the DSB agreed that the matter raised by the United States  be referred to arbitration in accordance with Article 22.6 of the DSU. Pursuant  to the Understanding regarding procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU,  the Article 22.6 arbitration proceeding was suspended until the completion of  the compliance proceeding. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> In light of the mutually agreed solution notified on 12 October 2006, the  suspended Article 22.6 arbitration proceeding was withdrawn.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3> Mutually agreed solution</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On  12 October 2006, the United States and Canada informed the DSB that they had  reached a mutually agreed solution under Article 3.6 of the DSU in the disputes  <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds236_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS236</a>, <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds247_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS247</a>, <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds257_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS257</a>, <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds264_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS264</a>, <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds277_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS277</a> and <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds311_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS311</a>.&nbsp; This solution was in the  form of a comprehensive agreement (Softwood Lumber Agreement) between the  United States and Canada, dated 12 September 2006. On 23 February 2007, the  United States and Canada informed the DSB that on 12 October 2006 they had  concluded a further Agreement, which amended the original Agreement to  facilitate its entry into force.</p>
