        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Canada. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 3   May 2002, Canada  requested consultations with the United States. The request concerned the final  affirmative countervailing duty determination by the US Department of Commerce  (File No. C&#8209;122839) issued on 25   March 2002, with respect to certain softwood lumber from Canada. The  measures at issue include the initiation and conduct of the investigation, the final  determination, provision of expedited reviews, and other matters related to  these measures. Canada contended that these measures were inconsistent with,  and violate the United States&rsquo; obligations under Articles 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 14,  15, 19, 22 and 32.1 of the SCM Agreement and Articles VI:3 and X:3 of the GATT  1994.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 18   July 2002, Canada  requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 29 July 2002, the DSB deferred the  establishment of a panel. On 19   August 2002, Canada  requested the withdrawal of its previous request for the establishment of a  panel and submitted a new request. In particular, Canada claimed that in initiating  the Lumber IV investigation, the United States had violated Articles  10, 11.4 and 32.1 of the SCM Agreement. In all the other claims, the new  request corresponded to the previous one (18 July 2002). At its meeting on 30 August 2002, the DSB  deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 1 October 2002, the DSB established a panel.  The European Communities, India  and Japan  reserved their third-party rights to participate in the panel proceedings. On 8 November 2002, the panel  was composed.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 29   August 2003, the panel report was circulated to Members. The panel  found that the USDOC Final Countervailing Duty Determination was inconsistent  with Articles 10, 14, 14(d) and 32.1 SCM&nbsp;Agreement and Article VI:3 of GATT 1994. The panel decided to apply judicial  economy as regards Canada&rsquo;s  claims under Article 19.4 SCM  Agreement and Article VI:3 of the GATT  1994 concerning the methodologies used to calculate the subsidy rate; and its  claims of violation of the procedural rules of evidence set forth in Article 12  SCM Agreement. Further to Canada&rsquo;s  statement at the first substantive meeting of the panel with the parties that  it did not consider it appropriate to press its claims under Articles 10, 11.4  and 32.1 of the SCM Agreement  concerning the initiation of the investigation, the panel also refrained from  addressing and making a ruling on these claims. Accordingly, the panel  recommended that the DSB request the United States to bring its measure  into conformity with its obligations under the SCM  Agreement and the GATT 1994.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 2   October 2003, the United    States notified the DSB of its decision to  appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the panel report  and certain legal interpretations developed by the panel. However, on 3 October 2003, the United States  withdrew its notice of appeal for scheduling reasons, although the withdrawal was  conditional on the United States'  right to file a new notice of appeal within the timeframe permitted by the DSU.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 21 October 2003, the United States notified the DSB  of its decision to re-file its appeal to the Appellate Body of certain issues  of law covered in the panel report and certain legal interpretations developed  by the panel.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 17 December 2003, the Chairman of the Appellate Body  informed the DSB that the Appellate Body would not be able to circulate its report  within the 60-day period due to the time required for completion and  translation of the report and it estimated that the Appellate Body report would  be circulated to WTO Members no later than 19 January 2004.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 19   January 2004, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members.  The Appellate Body:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">upheld  the panel&rsquo;s finding that the United States had correctly determined that  harvesting rights granted by Canadian provincial governments in respect of  standing timber constituted the provision of goods under Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">reversed  the panel&rsquo;s interpretation of Article 14(d) of the SCM Agreement and the panel&rsquo;s finding  that the US  had improperly determined the existence and amount of the &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; resulting  from the financial contribution provided. Then the Appellate Body found that it  was unable to complete the legal  analysis of whether the United States had correctly determined benefit  in this investigation, due to insufficient factual findings by the panel and  insufficient undisputed facts in the panel record; and<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">upheld  the panel&rsquo;s finding that the United States had acted inconsistently with  provisions of the SCM  Agreement and the GATT 1994  by failing to analyse whether subsidies were passed through in sales of <strong>logs</strong> by sawmill-owning harvesters to unrelated lumber producers. On the other hand,  the Appellate Body reversed the panel&rsquo;s  findings that the United States acted inconsistently with its WTO obligations  by failing to consider whether subsidies were passed through in sales of  primary <strong>lumber</strong> by sawmills to unrelated lumber remanufacturers, because  both primary and remanufactured lumbers were products subject to USDOC&rsquo;s  aggregate investigation. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 17 February 2004, the DSB adopted the  Appellate Body report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body  report.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Compliance proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 30 December 2004, Canada requested the establishment  of a panel under Article 21.5 of the DSU.&nbsp;  Canada considered that the measures allegedly taken by the United States  to comply with the DSB's recommendations and rulings were inconsistent with the  United States' obligations under Articles 10 and 32.1 of the SCM Agreement and  Article VI:3 of the GATT 1994. At its meeting on 14&nbsp;January 2005, the DSB agreed  to refer the matter raised by Canada  to the original panel. &nbsp;China and the  European Communities reserved their third party rights.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 14   January 2005, Canada  and the United States  notified the DSB of an Understanding regarding procedures under Articles 21 and  22 of the DSU, which provided that the Article 22.6 arbitration be suspended  until adoption by the DSB of the recommendations and rulings in the compliance  proceedings.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Due to the unavailability of one of the Members of the  original panel, the parties, pursuant to their Understanding regarding  procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU, agreed on a replacement panelist  on 7 February 2005.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 1   August 2005, the compliance panel report was circulated to Members.  The compliance panel found that the United States remains in violation  of Article 10 and 32.1 of the SCM  Agreement, and Article VI:3 of the GATT  1994. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 6   September 2005, the United States notified the DSB of its decision  to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the compliance  panel report and certain legal interpretations developed by the compliance panel  in this dispute. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 2 November 2005, the Chairman of the Appellate Body  informed the DSB that the Appellate Body would not be able to circulate its report  within the 60-day period due to the time required for completion and  translation of the report and estimated that the Appellate Body report would be  circulated to WTO Members no later than 5 December 2005.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 5   December 2005, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members.  &nbsp;The Appellate Body, referring to  previous cases, confirmed that the question of what measures may be examined by  a compliance panel is a question to be answered by panels and the Appellate  Body, rather than by the parties to the dispute. Although a Member&rsquo;s  declaration that a specific measure is the one that it has &ldquo;taken to comply&rdquo;  will always be relevant to this question, such a declaration is not  determinative. Some measures with a very close relationship to the declared  &ldquo;measure taken to comply&rdquo;, and to the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in  the original proceedings, may also be susceptible to review by a compliance panel.&nbsp;  In order to determine whether a specific measure does fall within its  jurisdiction, a panel will need to scrutinize the relationships between  relevant measures and to examine the timing, nature and effects of these  measures. The Appellate Body found that this was precisely the approach taken  by the compliance panel. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body highlighted that the compliance panel  had not found that all of the First Assessment Review fell within its  jurisdiction, but only the pass-through analysis employed by USDOC in that  proceeding. The Appellate Body found that the compliance panel  had&nbsp;correctly relied upon multiple and specific links between the  pass-through analysis in the First Assessment Review, the Section 129 Determination  and the final countervailing duty determination that was at issue in the  original proceedings. All three proceedings involved the issue of pass-through,  and covered imports of softwood lumber from Canada.&nbsp; The publication dates  of the First Assessment Review and the Section 129 Determination coincided very  closely in time (within four days of each other). In addition, the First  Assessment Review directly affected the Section 129 Determination because the  cash deposit rate resulting from the Section 129 Determination (which reflected  a small reduction due to the pass-through analysis contained therein) was  replaced after 10 days by the cash deposit rate resulting from the First  Assessment Review (which reflected no reduction from the pass-through analysis  contained therein). </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> For these reasons, the Appellate Body upheld the compliance  panel&rsquo;s finding that the First Assessment Review fell within the scope of these  Article&nbsp;21.5 proceedings, insofar as the pass-through analysis is  concerned. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> As the United States did not request the Appellate Body  to examine the substance of the findings made by the compliance panel with  respect to the pass-through analysis in the First Assessment Review, the  Appellate Body declined to disturb the compliance panel&rsquo;s findings that this  analysis was inconsistent with the United States&rsquo; obligations under the SCM Agreement and the GATT  1994. Instead, the Appellate Body simply found that the compliance panel had  acted within the scope of its jurisdiction in making such findings. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting of 20 December 2005, the DSB adopted the  Appellate Body report and compliance panel report, as upheld by the Appellate  Body report.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Proceedings  under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext">
          On 30 December 2004, simultaneous to its request for  compliance proceedings (see above), Canada requested the DSB authorization to  suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the United States  under Article 22.2 of the DSU in an amount that will be established each year  based on the portion of the applicable countervailing duty rate for that year  which is illegal due to the failure of Commerce to conduct an appropriate  &ldquo;pass-through&rdquo; analysis. For 2005, Canada requested authorization to  suspend concessions or other obligations covering trade in the amount of CAD&nbsp;200,000,000.  On 13 January 2005, the United States objected to the level of suspension of  concessions or other obligations proposed by Canada and requested this matter  to be referred to arbitration in accordance with Article 22.6 of the DSU. At  its meeting of 14 January 2005, the DSB agreed that the matter raised by the  United States was referred to arbitration in accordance with Article 22.6 of  the DSU. Due to the unavailability of one of the Members of the original panel  to serve in the Article 22.6 arbitration proceedings, the parties, pursuant to their  Understanding regarding procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU, agreed on  a replacement arbitrator on 7&nbsp;February 2005. As a result the same  individuals serving as panelists in the compliance proceeding (see above)  accepted to serve in the arbitration.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Pursuant to the Understanding regarding procedures  under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU, the Article 22.6 arbitration proceedings were  suspended until either party requests their resumption following adoption by  the DSB of the recommendations and rulings in the compliance proceedings. In  light of the mutually agreed solution of 12 October 2006 (see below), the  suspended Article 22.6 arbitration proceedings were withdrawn.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3> Mutually agreed solution</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 12 October 2006, the United States and Canada  informed the DSB that they had reached a mutually agreed solution under Article  3.6 of the DSU in the disputes <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds236_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS236</a>, <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds247_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS247</a>, <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds257_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS257</a>, <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds264_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS264</a>, <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds277_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS277</a> and  <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds311_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS311</a>.&nbsp; This solution was in the form of  a comprehensive agreement (Softwood Lumber Agreement) between the United States  and Canada, dated 12 September 2006. On 23 February 2007, the United States and  Canada informed the DSB that on 12 October 2006 they had concluded a further  Agreement, which amended the original Agreement to facilitate its entry into  force.</p>
