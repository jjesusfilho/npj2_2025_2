      <h3>Consultations</h3>

      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Japan.  </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 24 November 2004, Japan requested consultations with  the United States concerning (1) the USDOC&rsquo;s &ldquo;zeroing&rdquo; practice in anti-dumping  investigations, administrative reviews, sunset reviews, and also in assessing  the final anti-dumping duty liability on entries upon liquidation; (2) the  USDOC&rsquo;s &ldquo;irrefutable presumption&rdquo; in sunset reviews; and (3) the waiver  provisions of US law, which, in sunset reviews, oblige the USDOC, in certain  situations, to find a likelihood of continuation or recurrence of dumping  without performing a substantive review.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> According to the request for consultations from Japan,  the US violates  its WTO obligations with respect to the following measures:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>the Tariff Act of 1930, in particular, sections  731, 751, 752, 771(7), 771(35)(A), 771(35)(B) and 777A(d);&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>the Statement of Administrative Action that  accompanied the Uruguay Round Agreements Act; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>the USDOC implementing regulations, 19 C.F.R.  section 351, in particular sections 351.218 and 351.414; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>the Import Administration Antidumping Manual,  including the computer program(s) to which it refers; &mdash; the USDOC's Policy  Bulletin 98.3 (&ldquo;Sunset Policy Bulletin&rdquo;); <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>the methodology of the United    States for determining dumping margins and  material injury in anti dumping investigations; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>the methodology of the United    States for determining dumping margins in  administrative reviews; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>the methodology of the United    States, in sunset reviews, for determining whether  revocation of anti-dumping orders would be likely to lead to continuation or  recurrence of dumping, and continuation or recurrence of material injury within  a reasonably foreseeable time. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Japan  wishes to consult with the United States  not only on the above-mentioned measures &ldquo;as such&rdquo;, but also on the  applications of these measures in 16 specific instances.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> Japan considers that these US measures are inconsistent  with, inter alia, Articles 1, 2.1, 2.4, 2.4.2, 3, 5.8, 6.1, 6.2, 9, 11,  18.3 and 18.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement; Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT;  and Article XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 3 December   2004, India  requested to join the consultations. On 8   December 2004, Norway,  Argentina,  Chinese Taipei, the European Communities and Mexico  requested to join the consultations.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 4 February   2005, Japan  requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 17 February 2005, the DSB deferred the  establishment of a panel. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 28 February 2005, the DSB established the panel. The  European Communities; Hong Kong, China;  India; Korea  and Mexico  reserved their third party rights. On 2   March 2005, China  reserved its third party rights. On 4   March 2005, Argentina  reserved its third party rights. On 7   March 2005, Norway  reserved its third party rights. On 8   March 2005, Thailand  reserved its third party rights. On 10   March 2005, New Zealand  reserved its third party rights. On 7   April 2005, Japan  requested the Director General to compose the panel. On 15 April 2005, the Director-General composed the  panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 15 November 2005, the panel informed the DSB that it  would not be possible for the panel to complete its work within six months of  the date of composition, inter alia, due to the complexity of the issues  and other unavoidable postponements in the timetable for the work of the panel,  and that&nbsp;the panel hoped to complete its work by March 2006. On 10 May  2006, the panel informed the DSB that it would not be possible for the panel to  complete its work within six months due to the complexity of the issues and  that the panel hoped to complete its work by end August/early September 2006.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 20   September 2006, the panel report was circulated to Members. The panel  upheld Japan's  claim relating to the use of zeroing when used by the USDOC in the context of  multiple averaging in original investigations when calculating the margin of  dumping by finding that it is inconsistent with Article 2.42 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement. The panel also agreed with Japan  that the US  zeroing methodology is a &ldquo;norm&rdquo; capable of being challenged in WTO dispute  settlement proceedings. The panel rejected Japan's  claims that zeroing was prohibited in proceedings other than original  investigations, i.e. periodic reviews, new shipper reviews, changed  circumstances reviews and sunset reviews. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 11 October   2006, Japan  notified its decision to appeal certain issues of law covered in the panel  report and certain legal interpretations developed by the panel. On 23 October 2006, the United    States notified its decision to appeal  certain issues of law covered in the panel report and certain legal  interpretations developed by the panel. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 9 January   2007, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members. The  Appellate Body: </p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>upheld the panel's finding that the United  States' zeroing procedures constitute a measure which can be challenged, as  such, and therefore dismissed the United States' claim that the panel acted  inconsistently with Article 11 of the DSU by concluding that the zeroing procedures,  as the relate to original investigations based on transaction-to-transaction an  weighted average normal value-to-prices of individual export transactions  comparisons, constitute a measure that can be challenged, as such, in WTO  dispute settlement.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>reversed the panel's finding that the United  States does not act inconsistently with Articles 2.1, 2.4 and 2.4.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT  1994, and found instead that the United Sates acts inconsistently with Articles  2.4 and 2.4.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement by maintaining zeroing procedures  when calculating margins of dumping on the basis of transaction-to-transaction  comparisons in original investigations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>reversed the panel's findings that the United  States does not act inconsistently with Articles 2.1, 2.4 and 9.1-9.3 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT  1994, and found instead that the United States acts inconsistently with  Articles 2.4 and 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT  1994 by maintaining zeroing procedures in periodic reviews.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>reversed the panel's findings that the United  States does not act inconsistently with Articles 2.1, 2.4 and 9.5 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT  1994, and found instead that the United States acts inconsistently with  Articles 2.4 and 9.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement by maintaining zeroing  procedures in new shipper reviews.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>reversed the panel's findings that the United  States does not act inconsistently with Articles 2.1, 2.4 and 9.1-9.3 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT  1994, and found instead that the United States acted inconsistently with  Articles 2.4 and 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT  1994 by applying zeroing procedures in the 11 periodic reviews at issue in this  appeal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>reversed the panel's finding that the United  States did not act inconsistently with Articles 2 and 11 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement in the sunset reviews at issue in this appeal, when it relied on  margins of dumping calculated in previous proceedings through the use of  zeroing, and found instead that the United States acted inconsistently with  Article 11.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 23 January 2007, the DSB adopted the Appellate   Body report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate   Body report.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Compliance proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 10 March   2008, the United States  and Japan  informed the DSB of confirmed procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU.  On 7 April 2008, Japan  requested the establishment of a compliance panel. At its meeting on 18 April 2008, the DSB agreed to  refer to the original panel, if possible, the question whether the United    States had complied with the DSB  recommendations and rulings. China;&nbsp;  the European Communities;&nbsp; Hong Kong, China;&nbsp;  Norway and  Chinese Taipei reserved their third party rights. Subsequently, Korea,  Mexico and Thailand  reserved their third party rights. On 23   May 2008, the compliance panel was composed. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 1 August   2008, the Chairman of the compliance panel informed the DSB that it  would not be possible to complete its work in 90&nbsp;days in light of  scheduling conflicts.&nbsp; The compliance panel expected to complete its work  in April 2009. On 24 April 2009,  the report of the compliance panel was circulated to Members.&nbsp; The compliance panel found that the United    States had failed to comply with the DSB's  recommendations and rulings regarding the importer-specific assessment rates  determined in Reviews 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8 that apply to entries covered by those  Reviews that were, or would be, liquidated after the expiry of the RPT.&nbsp; Accordingly, the compliance panel found that  the United States  is in continued violation of its obligations under Articles 2.4 and 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT  1994.&nbsp; The compliance panel declined to  rule on Japan's  claim that this failure to comply is inconsistent with the United    States' obligations under Articles 17.14,  21.1 and 21.3 of the DSU.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> The compliance panel further found that the United    States has acted inconsistently with  Articles 2.4 and 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT  1994 by applying zeroing in the context of Reviews 4, 5, 6 and 9.&nbsp; The compliance panel found that the United    States had failed to comply with the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB regarding the United    States' maintenance of zeroing procedures  challenged &ldquo;as such&rdquo; in the original proceedings.&nbsp; In particular, the compliance panel found  that the United States  had failed to implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings in the context of  transaction-to-transaction comparisons in original investigations and under any  comparison methodology in periodic and new shipper reviews. Accordingly, the  compliance panel found that the United States  remains in violation of Articles&nbsp;2.4, 2.4.2, 9.3 and 9.5 of the Anti-Dumpng  Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT  1994.&nbsp;  The compliance panel declined to rule on Japan's  claim that this failure to comply is inconsistent with the United    States' obligations under Articles 17.14,  21.1 and 21.3 of the DSU.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> The compliance panel also found that the United    States was in violation of Article II:1(a)  and II:1(b) of the GATT 1994 with respect to  certain liquidation actions taken after the expiry of the RPT,  namely with respect to certain USDOC liquidation instructions and USCBP  liquidation notices.&nbsp; The compliance panel  further found that the United States  had failed to comply with the DSB's recommendations and rulings with respect to  the 1999 sunset review and that it therefore remained in violation of  Article&nbsp;11.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. &nbsp;The compliance panel declined to rule on Japan's  claim that this failure to implement is inconsistent with the United    States' obligations under Articles 17.14,  21.1 and&nbsp;21.3 of the DSU.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> The compliance panel concluded that, to the extent that  the United States has failed to comply with the recommendations and rulings of  the DSB in the original dispute, the recommendations and rulings remained  operative, and recommended that the DSB request the United States to bring  Reviews 4, 5, 6 and 9, and the liquidation actions into conformity with the AD Agreement and the GATT  1994.On 20 May 2009, the United    States notified the DSB of its decision to  appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of  law covered in the report of the compliance panel and certain legal  interpretations developed by the compliance panel.&nbsp; On 14   July 2009, the Chairman of the Appellate Body  notified the DSB that due to the time required for completion and translation  of the report, the Appellate Body would not be  able to circulate its report within 60 days.&nbsp;  It was estimated that the report would be circulated no later than 18 August 2009.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 18 August   2009, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members.&nbsp; The Appellate Body upheld the compliance panel's findings that Review 9 was properly within the panel's terms of reference and that the United States  has failed to comply with the DSB's recommendations and rulings regarding the  importer-specific assessment rates determined in Reviews 1, 2, 3, 7, and&nbsp;8  that apply to entries covered by those Reviews that were, or will be,  liquidated after the expiry of the reasonable period of time.&nbsp; The Appellate Body also upheld the following  findings of the compliance panel:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>that the United States is in continued violation of its  obligations under Articles 2.4 and 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and  Article VI:2 of the GATT 1994;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>that the United States has acted inconsistently  with Articles 2.4 and 9.3 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT&nbsp;1994  by applying zeroing in the context of Reviews 4, 5, 6, and 9;&nbsp; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>that the United States is in violation of  Article II:1(a) and&nbsp;II:1(b) of the </a>GATT 1994 with respect to certain liquidation  actions taken after the expiry of the reasonable period of time with respect to  certain USDOC liquidation instructions and Customs liquidation notices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">To the extent that the United    States has failed to comply with the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB in the original dispute, the Appellate  Body found that the recommendations and rulings remain operative.&nbsp; The Appellate Body recommends that the DSB  request the United States  to bring into conformity with its obligations under the Anti-Dumping Agreement and the GATT  1994 the measures found to be inconsistent with those Agreements.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 31 August   2009, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body  report and the compliance panel report, as upheld by the Appellate   Body report.</p>

    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 10 January   2008, on the grounds that the United    States had failed to implement the DSB  recommendations and rulings, Japan  requested the DSB authorization to suspend concessions pursuant to  Article&nbsp;22.2 of the DSU. On 18   January 2008, the United States  objected to the level of suspension and accordingly requested the matter to be  referred to arbitration under Article 22.6 of the DSU. At its meeting on 21 January 2008, the DSB agreed that  the matter had been referred to arbitration as required under Article 22.6 of  the DSU. &nbsp;On 6 June 2008, the United    States and Japan  requested the Arbitrator to suspend its work.&nbsp; Accordingly, the  arbitration proceedings were suspended from 9 June 2008 until either party requests their  resumption.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 23 April 2010, Japan requested the Arbitrator to resume the  arbitration proceedings.&nbsp; One of the  members of the Arbitrator indicated that he was no longer available.&nbsp; On 25 May 2010, Japan requested the Director-General to appoint a  replacement arbitrator.&nbsp;  The constitution of the arbitrator was notified to the DSB on 3 June 2010.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 15 December 2010, Japan and the United States  jointly requested the Arbitrator to suspend its work in the context of informal  discussions with respect to implementation.&nbsp;  On 12 September 2011, 7 November 2011, 30 November 2011, 12 January  2012, 1 February 2012, Japan and the United States jointed requested the  Arbitrator to continue the suspension of its work. On the basis of these  requests, the Arbitrator decided to suspend its work.&nbsp; As requested by the parties, the suspension  will be automatically terminated and the work of the Arbitrator will resume on21  August 2012, unless Japan submits a written communication to the contrary to  the Arbitrator by 20 August 2012.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 6 February 2012, the United States and Japan  informed the DSB of a Memorandum of Understanding regarding this dispute.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 3 August 2012, Japan withdrew its request for  authorization from the DSB to  suspend the application of concessions or other obligations under the covered  agreements pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU.&nbsp;  The withdrawal followed the completion by the United States of the steps  undertaken pursuant to the Memorandum of  Understanding notified to the DSB in February&nbsp;2012.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 14 August 2012,  the Chairman of the Arbitrator informed the DSB that the Arbitrator had  received a joint communication dated 3 August 2012  from Japan and the United States  in which they stated that as Japan had  withdrawn is request under Article 22.2 of the DSU, the United States  accordingly no longer made objections under Article 22.6 of the DSU.&nbsp; Therefore, the United States and Japan  requested the Arbitrator to notify the DSB that it  was not necessary for the Arbitrator to  issue an award in this dispute. Pursuant to this joint communication, the  Arbitrator considered that it was not necessary for it to issue a decision on  the matter referred to it. The Arbitrator therefore considered that it had  completed its work.</p></div>
