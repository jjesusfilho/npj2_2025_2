On 30 July 2020, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB  that due to the volume of materials submitted during these proceedings and  logistical constraints arising from the current circumstances, the panel  expected to issue its final report to the parties in the latter half of 2020.</p>

    	    <p>This  dispute concerns anti-dumping duties imposed by Korea on certain stainless  steel bars from Japan.</p>
            <p><strong>Japan's  claims concerning price and volume effects and &ldquo;other injury factors&rdquo;  under Article 11.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement</strong></p>
            <p>Japan  claimed that Korea's investigating authority made a number of errors in its  assessment of prices and volumes when concluding that, once the anti-dumping measures are terminated,  the resulting drop in prices and increase in imports would be likely to lead to  a recurrence of injury. The Panel found that Korea's investigating authority  erred by failing to reconcile a tension in its own findings on this point. On  the one hand, the authority found that the Japanese pricing level upon the  termination of the duties would lead to a weakening of Korean price  competitiveness and an increase in Japanese imports. On the other hand, the  authority found that the Korean market was price-sensitive and that the Japanese  pricing level would remain significantly higher than Korean and third-country prices  even if the duties were terminated. For the Panel, the significance of  this tension was magnified by the authority's factual finding that a large  volume of low&#8209;priced imports from third countries was already present and  exerting price pressure in the Korean market. By failing to address how the  significantly higher&#8209;priced Japanese imports could weaken Korean price  competitiveness and be shipped in larger volumes in this context, the authority  failed to resolve the tension in its own findings. Accordingly, the authority  failed to undertake an &ldquo;unbiased and objective&rdquo; evaluation of the  facts on this point, which the Panel found to result in an inconsistency with  Article 11.3.</p>
            <p>Japan also claimed that Korea's investigating authority  failed to account for three factors that could explain the likely recurrence of  injury instead of the termination of the duties on Japan. These three factors were:  (a) the impact of the large volume of low&#8209;priced imports from third countries;  (b) the cost of raw materials; and (c) weak demand in  both the domestic and export markets. The Panel decided not to examine the  first factor because its substance was already addressed in its assessment of  Japan's claims concerning price and volume effects. For the remaining factors,  the Panel found that Japan had failed to establish a <em>prima facie</em> case of  inconsistency with Article&nbsp;11.3. The Panel reasoned that Japan's&nbsp;case  was limited to pointing out that these factors had been recognized by the authority  as sources of injury during the period of review without explaining how those specific injury factors  would sever or diminish the link between lifting the anti&#8209;dumping duties and  the likelihood that this would lead to a recurrence of injury.</p>
            <p><strong>Japan's  claims concerning capacity utilization under Articles 6.8 and 11.3 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement</strong></p>
            <p>Japan  claimed that Korea's investigating authority acted inconsistently with Articles  6.8 and 11.3 by rejecting the production capacity figures submitted by the  Japanese exporters and instead relying on another source for Japan's production  capacity as part of its determination of Japan's capacity utilization rate. The  Panel found that Korea's investigating authority initially requested production  capacity figures from the Japanese exporters based on certain parameters, and  subsequently changed its preferred parameters without adequately conveying this  change to the Japanese exporters. Accordingly, the Panel found that Korea's  authority acted inconsistently with Articles 6.8 and 11.3 by rejecting the  Japanese exporters' production capacity figures on the basis of their failure  to comply with new parameters of which they had not been informed. </p>
            <p><strong>Japan's  claim concerning confidentiality under Article 6.5 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement</strong></p>
            <p>Japan  claimed that Korea's investigating authority acted inconsistently with Article  6.5 with respect to its treatment of 102 pieces of information as confidential  in the underlying review. The Panel accepted Japan's claim that Korea's  authority failed to ensure that there was &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; for treating  these pieces of information as confidential, whilst observing that there is  merit in Korea's general system for protecting information as confidential.</p>
            <p><strong>Judicial  economy </strong></p>
            <p>In view of  the aforementioned findings of inconsistency, the Panel decided that findings  on Japan's additional claims under Articles 6.5.1, 6.9, 11.3, 11.4, 12.2,  12.2.2, 12.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, paragraphs 3 and 7 of Annex II to  the Anti-Dumping Agreement, and Article VI:6(a) of the GATT, would add nothing  to the way in which Korea chooses to comply with those inconsistencies. The  Panel therefore decided to exercise judicial economy over those claims. </p>
          </div>

    <p class="paranormaltext">On  22 January 2021, Korea notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the  Appellate Body certain issues of law and legal interpretations in the panel  report. On 27 January 2021, Japan informed the DSB that it had taken note of  Korea's notification of its appeal and that,  given the current non-operational situation of the Appellate Body, it  considered that all the  procedural deadlines set out in the Appellate Body's Working Procedures were  suspended. Japan indicated that,  until the Appellate Body resumes its operation and sets the schedule for this  appeal, Japan reserved its full rights to file its own appeal on errors (if  any) in the issues of law covered in the panel report and legal interpretations  developed by the panel,  and submit any relevant submissions for this case.</p>
