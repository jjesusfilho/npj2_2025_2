      <h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Argentina. </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 7 October 2002, Argentina requested consultations
        with the US regarding the final determinations of the US Department of
        Commerce (“DOC”) and the US International Trade Commission
        (“ITC”) in the sunset reviews of the anti-dumping duty order on
        OCTG from Argentina, issued on 7 November 2000 (65 Federal Register 66701)
        and June 2001 (USITC Pub. No. 3434), respectively, and the DOC’s
        determination to continue the anti-dumping duty order on OCTG from
      Argentina, issued on 25 July 2001 (66 Federal Register 38630).</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Argentina considered that general US laws, regulations,
      policies and procedures related to the administration of sunset reviews
      and the application of anti-dumping measures were inconsistent either on
      their face or as applied with Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 11, 12, and 18 of
      the Anti-Dumping Agreement (ADA); Articles VI and X of the General
      Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994; and Article XVI:4 of the WTO
      Agreement.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Furthermore, Argentina claimed that the sunset review
      conducted by the DOC is inconsistent with Articles 2, 5, 5.8, 11.3, 11.4,
      12.1, and 12.3 of the ADA. It also claimed that the sunset review
      conducted by the ITC was inconsistent with Articles 3 and 11.3 of the ADA.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 3 April 2003, Argentina requested the establishment
      of a panel. At its meeting on 15 April 2003, the DSB deferred the
      establishment of the panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Further to a second request by Argentina, the
        DSB established a panel at its meeting on 19 May 2003. The EC, Japan,
        Korea, Mexico and Chinese Taipei reserved their third-party rights.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 22 August 2003, Argentina requested the
      Director-General to compose the panel. On 4 September 2003, the
      Director-General composed the panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 4 March 2004, the Chairman of the Panel informed the
      DSB that it would not be able to complete its work in six months in light
      of scheduling conflicts and that the Panel expected to complete its work
      in June 2004.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 16 July 2004, the report of the Panel was circulated
      to Members. The Panel found that:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>
          Certain provisions of United States’ law regarding
      waivers in sunset reviews and certain provisions of the Sunset Policy
      Bulletin (SPB) concerning the DOC’s obligation to determine likelihood of
      continuation or recurrence of dumping in sunset reviews are inconsistent
      with the US obligations under certain provisions of the ADA. With respect
      to the DOC’s likelihood determinations in the OCTG sunset review, the
      Panel finds that the DOC acted inconsistently with certain provisions of
      the ADA, but did not act inconsistently with other provisions of that
      Agreement;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          The US law’s standard for the likelihood of
      continuation or recurrence of injury determinations in sunset reviews and
      the ITC’s determinations in the OCTG sunset review are not inconsistent
      with the relevant articles of the ADA.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 31 August 2004, United States notified its intention
      to appeal certain issues of law and legal interpretations developed by the
      Panel. On 28 October 2004, the Chairman of the Appellate Body informed the
      DSB that the Appellate Body would not be able to circulate its Report
      within 60-day period due to the time required for completion and
      translation of the Report, and that the Appellate Body expected to
      complete its work no later than 29 November 2004.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 29 November 2004, the Appellate Body Report was
      circulated to Members. The Appellate Body:</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><b>with respect to the issues appealed by the United
      States:</b></p>

      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>
          <b>upheld</b> the Panel’s finding that Argentina’s
      challenges to certain provisions of United States law-namely, Sections
      751(c) and 752(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the Statement of
      Administrative Action, and the Sunset Policy Bulletin-were set out with
      sufficient clarity in Argentina’s request for the establishment of a
      panel, as required by Article 6.2 of the DSU;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>

      <li>
        <b>upheld</b> the Panel’s finding that the Sunset Policy
      Bulletin is a “measure” subject to WTO dispute settlement
      proceedings;<br>
        &nbsp;</li>

      <li>
        <b>found</b> that the Panel did not meet its obligation
      under Article 11 of the DSU to “make an objective assessment of the
      matter before it”, with respect to the Panel’s analysis leading to
      its conclusion that the Sunset Policy Bulletin is inconsistent with
      Article 11.3 of the <i>Anti-Dumping Agreement </i>(governing reviews of
      anti-dumping duties after five years) because the Panel relied solely on
      overall statistics and did not appear to conduct a qualitative analysis of
      the cases filed in evidence. Consequently, the Appellate Body <b>reversed</b>
      this conclusion of the Panel;<br>
        &nbsp;</li>

      <li>
        <b>upheld</b> the Panel’s finding that Section
      751(c)(4)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930 and Section 351.218(d)(2)(iii) of
      the USDOC Regulations-provisions that allow for parties to be considered
      to have waived their rights to participation in a sunset review proceeding
      under certain circumstances-are inconsistent with Article 11.3 of the <i>Anti-Dumping
      Agreement</i> because the USDOC’s determinations based on such waivers do
      not qualify as reasoned conclusions based on positive evidence;<br>
        &nbsp;</li>

      <li>
        <b>upheld</b> the Panel’s finding that Section
      351.218(d)(2)(iii) of the USDOC Regulations — a provision that allows for
      parties to be “deemed” to have waived their rights to
      participation in a sunset review proceeding under certain
        circumstances — is
      inconsistent with Articles 6.1 and 6.2 of the <i>Anti-Dumping Agreement</i>
      because the deemed waiver negates a party’s ample opportunity to present
      evidence and full opportunity to defend its interests as required by
      Article 6.1 and 6.2; and<br>
        &nbsp;</li>

      <li>
        <b>found</b> that the Panel, in the course of arriving at
      its conclusions on waivers (points 4 and 5 above), did not fail to meet
      its obligations under Article 11 of the DSU to “make an objective
      assessment of the matter before it, including an objective assessment of
      the facts of the case”;</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><b>with respect to the issues appealed by Argentina:</b></p>

      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>
          <b>upheld</b> the Panel’s finding that the disciplines in
      Article 3 of the <i>Anti-Dumping Agreement</i> regarding original
      determination of injury do not apply to investigating authorities when
      making determinations in sunset reviews. The Appellate Body further <b>found</b>
      that the Panel did not err in its interpretation of the term “injury” in Article 11.3 of the <i>Anti-Dumping Agreement</i>,
      or in its analysis with respect to the factors that must be considered by
      an investigating authority when making a determination in a sunset review;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>

      <li>
        <b>upheld</b> the Panel’s finding that investigating
      authorities are not prohibited, by virtue of Article 11.3 of the <i>Anti-Dumping
      Agreement</i>, from “cumulating” the effects of likely dumped
      imports when determining whether injury to the domestic industry would be
      likely to continue or recur after termination of anti-dumping duties. The
      Appellate Body further <b>upheld</b> the Panel’s finding that the
      conditions applicable to such “cumulation” set out in Article
      3.3 of the <i>Anti-Dumping Agreement</i> do not apply in the context of
      sunset reviews under Article 11.3;<br>
        &nbsp;</li>

      <li>
        <b>found</b> that the Panel did not err in its
      interpretation of the term “likely” in Article 11.3 of the <i>Anti-Dumping
      Agreement</i>, and <b>upheld</b> the Panel’s finding that the
      determination made by the United States International Trade Commission
      (“USITC”), with respect to the likelihood of continuation or
      recurrence of injury to the domestic industry upon termination of
      anti-dumping duties, was not inconsistent with Article 11.3 of the <i>Anti-Dumping
      Agreement</i>;<br>
        &nbsp;</li>

      <li>
        <b>upheld</b> the Panel’s finding that Sections 752(a)(1)
      and 752(a)(5) of the Tariff Act of 1930-which allow the USITC to consider
      the likelihood of injury recurring “within a reasonably foreseeable
      time”-are not inconsistent with Article 11.3 of the <i> Anti-Dumping
      Agreement.</i> The Appellate Body further <b>upheld</b> the Panel’s finding
      that the United States did not act inconsistently with Article 11.3 of the
      <i>Anti-Dumping Agreement </i>in the application of these provisions by
      the USITC in the sunset review determination underlying this dispute; and<br>
        &nbsp;</li>

      <li>
        <b>declined to rule</b> on Argentina’s conditional appeal
      of two issues, one under the <i>Anti-Dumping Agreement </i>relating to the
        “practice” of the USODC in sunset reviews, and the other under
      the GATT 1994 relating to the administration of sunset review laws by the
      USDOC.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 17 December 2004, the DSB adopted the
      Appellate Body report and the Panel report, as modified by the Appellate
      Body report.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Implementation  of adopted reports</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext">At the DSB meeting on 14
        January 2005, the United States stated that it was the intention
        of the US to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in a
        manner that respected its WTO obligations, and that it would consult
        with Argentina to exploring the possibility of reaching an agreement on
        the reasonable period of time to implement the recommendations and
        rulings of the DSB. On 11 March 2005, Argentina requested the DSB that
        the reasonable period of time be determined through binding arbitration
        pursuant to Article 21.3(c) of the DSU, as Argentina and the United
        Stated were not able to reach an agreement. On 16 March 2005, Argentina
        and the United States informed the DSB that both parties had agreed the
        period of time for this binding arbitration shall be completed no later
        than 60 days after the date of the appointment of the arbitrator, as the
        90-day period under Article 21.3 (c) was about to expire.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 8 April 2005, Mr. A.V. Ganesan, Member of the Appellate Body, informed Argentina and the United States that he accepts the appointment to serve as arbitrator.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 7 June 2005, the&nbsp;Award of the Arbitrator was circulated to&nbsp;Members. He determined that the reasonable period of time in this case is 12 months and would thus&nbsp;expire on 17 December 2005. </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">At the DSB meeting on 20 December 2005, the United States informed the DSB that it had implemented the DSB recommendations and rulings in this case. Argentina expressed doubts as to whether the US had fully implemented the DSB recommendations and rulings. On 5 January 2006, the parties informed the DSB of agreed procedures under Articles&nbsp;21 and 22 of the DSU.</p>
	  <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Appellate Body and Panel Compliance Reports (Article&nbsp;21.5) Adopted </h3>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 26 January 2006, Argentina requested consultations under Article 21.5 of the DSU and paragraph 1 of the parties' Agreed Procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU. On 6 March 2006, Argentina requested the establishment of a panel under Article 21.5 of the DSU.

        &nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
      <li>rejected Argentina's claim that, in declining to make a suggestion pursuant to Article 19.1 of the DSU, the Panel did not properly fulfil its duties under Articles 11 and 112.7 of the DSU.</li>

    <h3>Proceedings  under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 21   May 2007, Argentina requested authorization from the DSB to suspend  concessions pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU. On 1   June 2007,  the United States requested, in accordance with Article&nbsp;22.6  of the DSU, that the matter be referred to arbitration, since they objected to  the level of suspension of concessions proposed by Argentina. At its meeting on 4   June 2007,  the DSB decided to refer the matter to arbitration. On 21   June 2007,  the parties jointly requested the arbitrator to suspend the Article 22.6  arbitration proceeding until either party subsequently requests its resumption.  In accordance with the parties' joint request, the arbitrators suspended the  arbitration proceeding, until either party subsequently requests its  resumption. The arbitrators also took note of the parties' agreement that, if  either party decides to request resumption of the arbitration proceedings, that  party will provide the other party with 30 days' advance notice before making  such a request.</p></div>
