<p>This dispute  concerned the anti-dumping measure imposed by China on imports of cellulose  pulp originating from Canada. Canada challenged MOFCOM's determination of  injury in the anti-dumping investigation at issue. Although Canada's panel  request included claims regarding the determination of dumping and procedural  aspects of the investigation, Canada specifically abandoned these claims in its  first written submission. Canada requested that the Panel find that the measure  at issue is inconsistent with China's obligations under Articles&nbsp;3.1, 3.2,  3.4, and 3.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, and as a consequence also  inconsistent with Article&nbsp;1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and  Article&nbsp;VI of the GATT  1994. </p>
<p>Canada claimed that  MOFCOM acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement by failing to assess the significance of an absolute increase in dumped  imports in light of the factual circumstances in the market, such as domestic  demand, volume of domestic like product and non-dumped imports. The Panel rejected  Canada's claim, concluding, <em>inter alia, </em>that  MOFCOM was not obligated to consider the significance of an absolute increase  in imports in the context of changes in other factors. The Panel noted,  however, that the investigating authority's decision whether any given increase  in imports, whether considered significant or not, ultimately supports a  determination of injury caused by dumped imports is an element of causation analysis  under Article&nbsp;3.5.</p>
<p>Canada claimed that MOFCOM's consideration of price effects was inconsistent  with Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. MOFCOM considered that  the effect of the dumped imports was to depress prices to a significant degree.  Canada submitted several allegations of error in the MOFCOM's consideration of price  depression. The Panel upheld Canada's contention that MOFCOM failed to explain  the role of parallel price trends in the decline of the domestic like product  prices. The Panel also considered that MOFCOM failed to adequately explain its  conclusion that the dumped imports had the effect of significant price  depression in light of the fact that the prices of the dumped imports were  higher than those of the domestic like product during the latter part of the period  of investigation. The Panel  rejected Canada's arguments regarding MOFCOM's consideration of certain  business information and changes in the market share of the dumped imports. The Panel concluded that MOFCOM's consideration of the price effects  was inconsistent with Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </p>
<p>Canada claimed that  MOFCOM acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.4 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement by failing to objectively examine the domestic industry's market  share and to properly analyse and interpret data relating to factors that  showed an improvement in the state of the domestic industry. The Panel  considered that MOFCOM provided a plausible and reasonable explanation of the  positive trends in several factors, in particular that they were driven by the  expansion of the market for cellulose pulp in China and the domestic industry's  expansion. The Panel also considered that MOFCOM's evaluation of market share  was reasonable and objective. The Panel found that Canada had not established  that MOFCOM acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.4. </p>
<p>Canada claimed that  MOFCOM's demonstration of a causal relationship between the dumped imports and  injury to the domestic industry is inconsistent with Articles 3.1 and 3.5 of  the Anti-Dumping Agreement. Canada also claimed that MOFCOM failed to  objectively examine several &ldquo;other factors&rdquo; allegedly causing injury  to the domestic industry simultaneously with the dumped imports, namely: (a)  changes in cotton and viscose staple fibre prices; (b) domestic industry  overexpansion, overproduction and inventory build-up; (c) non-dumped imports;  and (d) shortage of cotton linter. The Panel found that MOFCOM failed to  demonstrate a causal relationship between the dumped imports and the injury to  the domestic industry consistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.5 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement. The Panel rejected Canada's allegation with regard to  the shortage of cotton linter, but upheld Canada's claim with regard to the remaining  &ldquo;other factors&rdquo;.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Panel also  upheld Canada's consequential claims that China acted inconsistently with  Article 1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI of the GATT 1994.</p>

<h3>Reasonable period of  time</h3>
<p> On 1 June 2017, Canada and China informed  the DSB that they had agreed that the reasonable period of time to implement  the DSB's recommendations and rulings would be 11 months. Accordingly, the  reasonable period of time is set to expire on 22&nbsp;April&nbsp;2018. At the  DSB meeting on 19&nbsp;June&nbsp;2017, China informed the DBS of its intention  to implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings and confirmed the agreement  with Canada on the reasonable period of time.</p>

<p align="left">
  On 11 January 2018, China informed the DSB  that, on 25 August 2017, China's Ministry of Commerce published a notice and  launched a re-investigation on cellulose pulp from Canada. China indicated that through this re-investigation China will  fully implement the DSB's recommendations and ruling in this dispute.</p>
<p align="left">On 2 May 2018, China and Canada informed the DSB of Agreed  Procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU (sequencing agreement).</p>
