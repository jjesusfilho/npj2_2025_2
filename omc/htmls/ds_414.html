        <h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by  the United States. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 15  September 2010, the United States requested consultations with China with  respect to measures imposing countervailing duties and anti-dumping duties on  grain oriented flat-rolled electrical steel (&ldquo;GOES&rdquo;) from the United States as  set forth in Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (&ldquo;MOFCOM&rdquo;)  Notice No. 21 [2010], including its annexes.&nbsp;  The subsidy that China determined to  confer a benefit are the &ldquo;Buy America&rdquo; provisions of the American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and also State government procurement  laws.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The United  States alleged that China appears to be acting inconsistently with its  obligations under:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>Articles 10, 11.2, 11.3, 12.3,  12.4.1, 12.7, 12.8, 15.1, 15.2, 15.5, 19, 22.2(iii), 22.3 and 22.5 of the SCM  Agreement,<br>
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>Articles 1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 6.9  and 12.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement; and<br>
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>Article VI of the GATT 1994. </li>
        </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 11   February 2011, the United    States requested the establishment of a  panel. &nbsp;At its  meeting on 24&nbsp;February   2011, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 25 March 2011, the DSB established a panel.&nbsp; The European Union, Honduras, India, Japan, Korea and Viet&nbsp;Nam  reserved their third party rights. Subsequently, Argentina and Saudi Arabia reserved  their third party rights.&nbsp; On 10 May 2011, the panel was composed. On 19&nbsp;September 2011, the Chairman of the  panel informed the DSB that the timetable adopted by the panel after  consultations with the parties, envisages that the  final report shall be issued to the parties by May 2012. The panel expects to  conclude its work within that time-frame.</p>
    
          <p class="paranormaltext"><a name="bkmk414r" id="bkmk414r"></a>On 15  June 2012, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

                        <p class="paranormaltext">1.&nbsp;This  dispute concerned measures imposing countervailing and anti-dumping duties on  grain oriented flat-rolled electrical steel (&ldquo;GOES&rdquo;) from the United  States.&nbsp; The measures were imposed by  China's Ministry of Commerce (&ldquo;MOFCOM&rdquo;) and the United States claimed  that they were inconsistent with China's commitments and obligations under the  Anti-Dumping Agreement, the SCM Agreement and the GATT 1994.&nbsp; </p>
               <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>The  United States' claims with respect to initiation of certain countervailing duty  investigations</strong></p>

                        <p class="paranormaltext">2.&nbsp;The  United States claimed that China acted inconsistently with Articles 11.2 and  11.3 of the SCM Agreement because MOFCOM initiated countervailing duty  investigations into 11 programmes without sufficient evidence to justify this.&nbsp; The Panel concluded that the obligation upon  Members in relation to the sufficiency of evidence in a countervailing duty  investigation finds expression in Article 11.3 of the SCM Agreement, which  provides that an investigating authority must assess the accuracy and adequacy  of the evidence in an application to determine whether it is sufficient to  justify initiation.&nbsp; The Panel reached  its conclusions by reference to the requirements for &ldquo;sufficient  evidence&rdquo; set forth in Article 11.2, but did not consider it necessary to  reach separate conclusions under this provision.&nbsp; With respect to each of the 11 programmes at  issue, the Panel concluded that China had acted inconsistently with Article  11.3 of the SCM Agreement.</p>
               <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>The  United States' claims with respect to the non-confidential summaries</strong></p>
                       <p class="paranormaltext">3.&nbsp;The  applicants for initiation sought and obtained from MOFCOM confidential  treatment in relation to a number of categories of information.&nbsp; The United States claimed that MOFCOM acted  inconsistently with Articles 12.4.1 of the SCM Agreement and 6.5.1 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement by failing to require the applicants to submit adequate  non-confidential summaries of the information.&nbsp;  The Panel upheld the United States' claim.&nbsp; The Panel concluded that the purported  summaries did not provide a reasonable understanding of the substance of the  information submitted in confidence.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>The  United States' claim with respect to public notice of the calculations used to  determine the dumping margins </strong></p>
                        <p class="paranormaltext">4.&nbsp;The  United States claimed that MOFCOM did not disclose the data and calculations it  used to arrive at the dumping margins for the two respondent companies and that  this was inconsistent with Article 12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.&nbsp; The Panel rejected the United States'  claim.&nbsp; The Panel could not find within  the text of Article 12.2.2 an obligation to include in the relevant public  notice or separate report the confidential data and calculations underlying a  dumping margin.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>The  United States' claim with respect to public notice of the findings and conclusions  leading to MOFCOM's benefit determination under the government procurement  statutes</strong></p>
                       <p class="paranormaltext">5.&nbsp;The  United States claimed that MOFCOM did not adequately explain, in either the  preliminary or final determinations, why the exclusion of foreign producers  from the competitive bidding process under the United States Government  procurement statutes led to the conclusion that the resulting prices were not  market prices for the purposes of the benefit determination.&nbsp; According to the United States, this was  inconsistent with Article 22.3 of the SCM Agreement.&nbsp; The Panel rejected the United States'  claim.&nbsp; The Panel held that Article 22.3  does not discipline the substantive adequacy of an investigating authority's  reasoning.&nbsp; In the Panel's view, MOFCOM  included in its public notice the findings and conclusions on matters of law  that it considered material, and also referred to the material facts it was  relying upon to reach those conclusions.</p>
             <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>The  United States' claims with respect to the use of facts available </strong></p>
                       <p class="paranormaltext">6.&nbsp;The  United States brought a number of claims regarding MOFCOM's resort to facts  available in calculating certain dumping and subsidy rates.&nbsp; Although the Panel rejected the United  States' claim that MOFCOM improperly resorted to facts available to calculate  the subsidy rates for the two known respondent exporters, the Panel concluded  that the manner in which MOFCOM applied facts available was inconsistent with Article  12.7 SCM Agreement.</p>
                        <p class="paranormaltext">7.&nbsp;The  Panel upheld the United States' claim that China had acted inconsistently with  Article 6.8 and paragraph 1 of Annex II of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and  Article 12.7 of the SCM Agreement because MOFCOM improperly resorted to facts  available in calculating the dumping and subsidy rates for exporters that were  unknown to it.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p class="paranormaltext">8.&nbsp;The  United States also brought claims under Articles 6.9, 12.2 and 12.2.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and Articles 12.8, 22.3 and 22.5 of the SCM Agreement,  arguing that China did not disclose the essential facts, or provide in  sufficient detail in its final determination the findings and conclusions  leading to the application of facts available to &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; United  States exporters.&nbsp; The Panel upheld the  United States' claims in this regard.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>The  United States' claims with respect to MOFCOM's price effects analysis</strong></p>
                        <p class="paranormaltext">9.&nbsp;The  United States challenged MOFCOM's finding that the dumped and subsidized  imports had significant price effects.&nbsp;  The United States contended that MOFCOM's analysis of these price  effects was conclusory, failed to reflect an objective examination of the  evidence, and was not based on positive evidence.&nbsp; The Panel upheld the United States' claims,  finding that China had acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement, and Articles&nbsp;15.1 and 15.2 of the SCM Agreement.</p>
                        <p class="paranormaltext">10.&nbsp;The  United States also claimed that China did not disclose the essential facts  supporting its price effects analysis and did not offer an adequate explanation  for its price effects findings, in violation of Articles 6.9 and 12.2.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and 12.8 and 22.5 of the SCM Agreement.&nbsp; The Panel also upheld these claims.</p>
              <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>The  United States' claims with respect to MOFCOM's causation analysis</strong></p>
                        <p class="paranormaltext">11. The  United States claimed that MOFCOM's causation analysis was inconsistent with  Articles 3.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and 15.5 of the SCM Agreement, on  the basis that MOFCOM erroneously concluded that the rapid increase in the  capacity of the domestic GOES industry during the period of investigation could  not have been a cause of injury to the domestic industry.&nbsp; The United States also claimed that MOFCOM's  analysis was inconsistent with Articles 3.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and  15.1 of the SCM Agreement because it did not comply with the &ldquo;objective  examination&rdquo; and &ldquo;positive evidence&rdquo; requirements embodied in  those provisions.&nbsp; The Panel upheld the  United States' claims.</p>
                        <p class="paranormaltext">12. The  United States also claimed that China acted inconsistently with Articles 6.9  and 12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and 12.8 and 22.5 of the SCM  Agreement, on the basis that China failed to disclose the essential facts  supporting its analysis and did not provide an adequate explanation for its  causation findings.&nbsp; The Panel upheld  these claims.</p>

    <p class="paranormaltext">On 20 July 2012, China notified the DSB of it decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law and legal interpretations covered in the panel report. On 18 September 2012, the Chair of the Appellate  Body informed the DSB that due to the time required for completion and  translation of the report, the Appellate Body would not be able to circulate its report within the 60&#8209;day  period. &nbsp;It was estimated that the Appellate Body  report would be circulated no later than 18 October&nbsp;2012.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>China&rsquo;s appeal was limited to the Panel&rsquo;s findings in relation to  MOFCOM&rsquo;s price effects finding and the related disclosure of underlying  facts.&nbsp; China claimed that the Panel  erred in the interpretation and application of Article 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article 15.2  of the SCM Agreement in finding that  China acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Articles 15.1  and 15.2 of the SCM Agreement. &nbsp;China also claimed that the Panel erred in  finding that China acted inconsistently with Articles 6.9 and 12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, and  Articles&nbsp;12.8 and 22.5 of the SCM  Agreement, in relation to MOFCOM&rsquo;s final disclosure, and public notice and  explanation, of the facts underlying its price effects finding.</p>
            <p>The Appellate Body <strong>upheld</strong> the  Panel&rsquo;s finding that MOFCOM&rsquo;s price effects finding was inconsistent with  Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement and Articles 15.1 and 15.2 of the SCM Agreement.&nbsp; The Appellate  Body interpreted Article 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement and Article 15.2 of the SCM  Agreement as requiring an investigating authority to consider the  relationship between subject imports and the prices of the like domestic  products so as to understand whether the volumes and/or prices of subject  imports provide explain the occurrence of significant depression or suppression  of domestic prices.&nbsp; Like the Panel, the  Appellate Body rejected China&rsquo;s interpretation that Articles 3.2 and 15.2  merely require an investigating authority to consider the existence of price  depression or suppression, and do not require the consideration of any link  between subject imports and these price effects.</p>
            <p>With regard to the Panel&rsquo;s application of the legal standard under  Articles 3.2 and 15.2, read together with Articles 3.1 and 15.1, the Appellate  Body found that the Panel was correct to conclude that MOFCOM&rsquo;s finding as to  the &ldquo;low price&rdquo; of subject imports referred to the existence of price  undercutting, and that MOFCOM relied on this factor to support its finding of  significant price depression and suppression. The Appellate Body also found that the Panel did not improperly  disregard the parallel price trends of subject imports and domestic products,  or the role that the increase in the volume of subject imports played in  MOFCOM&rsquo;s price effects finding.&nbsp; Although  the Appellate Body considered that the Panel did not properly examine the  effect of a policy aiming at undercutting domestic prices, it found no basis to  reverse the Panel&rsquo;s price effects finding in this case.&nbsp; Moreover, the Appellate Body found that the  Panel did not act inconsistently with its duty to make an objective assessment  under Article 11 of the DSU.</p>
            <p>The Appellate Body <strong>upheld</strong> the Panel&rsquo;s finding that China acted inconsistently with Article 6.9 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article&nbsp;12.8  of the SCM Agreement.&nbsp; The Appellate Body agreed with the Panel that  MOFCOM failed to disclose in its preliminary determination and its final injury  disclosure document all the &ldquo;essential facts&rdquo; relating to the  &ldquo;low price&rdquo; of subject imports on which it relied for its price  effects finding.&nbsp; The Appellate Body also  <strong>upheld</strong> the Panel&rsquo;s finding that China  acted inconsistently with Article 12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article&nbsp;22.5 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement because MOFCOM failed  to disclose in its final determination &ldquo;all relevant information on the  matters of fact&rdquo; relating to the &ldquo;low price&rdquo; of subject imports  on which it relied for its price effects finding.&nbsp; In both instances, the Appellate Body found  that MOFCOM was required to disclose under Articles 6.9 and 12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and  Articles&nbsp;12.8 and 22.5 of the SCM  Agreement the price comparisons of subject imports and domestic products that  were necessary to understand MOFCOM&rsquo;s finding regarding the &ldquo;low price&rdquo;  of subject imports.</p></div>

<h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB  meeting on 30 November 2012, China  stated that it  intended to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings in  a manner that respects its WTO obligations.&nbsp;  China added that it would need a reasonable  period of time to do so. On 8 February 2013, the United States requested that  the reasonable period of time be determined through binding arbitration  pursuant to Article&nbsp;21.3(c) of the DSU.&nbsp;  On 22 February 2013, the United States requested the Director-General to  appoint the arbitrator. On 28 February 2013, the Director-General appointed Mr  Claus-Dieter Ehlermann to act as arbitrator under Article 21.3(c) of the DSU.&nbsp; On 4 March 2013, Mr Ehlermann accepted this  appointment.</p>

<h3>Compliance proceedings</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 13 January 2014, the  United States requested consultations pursuant to Article 21.5 of the DSU. On  13 February 2014, the United States requested the establishment of a compliance  panel.

The  European Union, India, Japan and the Russian Federation reserved their  third-party rights. On 17 March 2014, the compliance panel was composed. On 22  September 2014, the Chair of the compliance panel informed the DSB that the  compliance panel expected to issues its final report to the parties in the  second quarter of 2015.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p class="paranormaltext">This  compliance dispute concerned measures taken by China to implement the DSB's  recommendations and rulings in <strong>China &mdash;  Countervailing and Anti-Dumping duties on Grain Oriented Flat-rolled Electrical  Steel from the United&nbsp;States</strong>, as set forth in the redetermination  issued by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (MOFCOM)  on 31 July 2013. Pursuant to this redetermination, China continued to impose  anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of GOES from the United  States. The United States claimed that MOFCOM's redetermination violated  various substantive and procedural provisions of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and  the SCM Agreement.</p>
            <p><strong>The United States' claim with respect to adverse  impact</strong></p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The  United States claimed that, in its redetermination, MOFCOM failed to properly examine the impact of the subject imports on  the domestic industry and to evaluate all relevant economic factors and indices  having a bearing on the state of the domestic industry, consistently with  China's obligations under Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.4 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement and Articles&nbsp;15.1 and 15.4 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. The  Panel found that the United States' claim regarding adverse impact pertained to  those aspects of the redetermination that were essentially unchanged from the  original determination, and that were not challenged by the United States in  the original proceedings. Therefore, the Panel concluded that this claim of the  United States was not properly before it, and accordingly did not rule on this  claim.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>The United  States' claim regarding price effects of subject imports</strong></p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The  United&nbsp;States claimed that MOFCOM's conclusion that the subject imports  had a suppressive and depressive effect on the prices of the domestic like  product was not based on an objective examination of positive evidence, in  violation of China's obligations under Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and Articles&nbsp;15.1 and 15.2 of the  SCM&nbsp;Agreement. The Panel upheld the United States' claim, particularly  because upon review of MOFCOM's finding that the increased volume of subject  imports and the consequential loss in the domestic industry's market share to the  subject imports had a suppressive and depressive effect on the domestic like  product prices, the Panel found serious errors in MOFCOM's analysis of the  underlying evidence. In the Panel's view, these errors called into question whether  MOFCOM's conclusion regarding price effects was supported by reasoned  explanations and was such as could have been reached by an objective  investigating authority considering the evidence.</p>
            <p><strong>The United States' claim with respect to causation</strong></p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The  United&nbsp;States claimed that MOFCOM's finding of  causation was inconsistent with China's obligations under Articles&nbsp;3.1 and  3.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Articles&nbsp;15.1 and 15.5 of the  SCM&nbsp;Agreement because it was not based on an &ldquo;objective  examination&rdquo; and &ldquo;positive evidence&rdquo;. In particular, the United  States argued that because MOFCOM's causation determination relied on a  defective price effects analysis, MOFCOM's causation analysis must also fail. The  United States also questioned other aspects of MOFCOM's causation analysis such  as MOFCOM's conclusion that the Chinese domestic industry was unable to benefit from the  economies of scale, and argued that MOFCOM failed to properly consider the  effects of other causes of injury, such as the effect of the expansion and  increased production of the Chinese domestic industry as well as the effect of  non-subject imports on the domestic industry. The Panel agreed with the United  States' arguments and upheld its claim on causation.</p>
            <p><strong>The United States' claim with respect to disclosure </strong></p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The  United States claimed that MOFCOM's failure to disclose certain facts under  consideration that formed the basis of MOFCOM's redetermination was  inconsistent with China's obligations under Article 6.9 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article  12.8 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. Regarding the United States' claim that  MOFCOM failed to disclose essential facts regarding its finding on price  effects, the Panel found that MOFCOM acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;6.9  of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article 12.8 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement to the  extent it failed to even attempt to provide a non-confidential disclosure of  essential facts regarding domestic prices that formed the basis of its  consideration of parallel pricing. However, the Panel rejected the United  States' claim that MOFCOM failed to disclose the essential facts under  consideration on the basis of which it made its findings that the domestic  industry's loss in market share in 2008 led it to slash prices in Q1 2009,  noting that MOFCOM did disclose the facts that it actually relied upon to make  that finding.&nbsp; The Panel also rejected  the United States' claim that MOFCOM failed to disclose facts underlying its  finding that the price-cost differential of one of the two Chinese domestic  producers decreased in 2008. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">Regarding  the United States' claim that MOFCOM failed to disclose essential facts  regarding its causation determination, the  Panel found that MOFCOM failed to comply with the relevant obligations because  it saw nothing in MOFCOM's redetermination  disclosure that could be understood to constitute the essential facts  concerning the sales obstacles that MOFCOM considered the domestic industry was  facing. However, the Panel saw no basis for a finding that MOFCOM failed to  comply with the obligation to disclose the essential facts under consideration  with respect to MOFCOM's substantively inadequate determinations regarding the  domestic industry's inability to achieve economies of scale and the domestic  industry's inventory overhang. The Panel also saw no basis for a finding  that MOFCOM failed to comply with the obligation to disclose essential facts regarding capacity, output and demand.</p>
            <p><strong>The United States' claim with respect to public  notice</strong></p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The  United&nbsp;States  claimed that MOFCOM's public notice, i.e. MOFCOM's redetermination finding, was  inconsistent with China's obligations under Articles&nbsp;12.2 and 12.2.2 of  the Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement and Articles&nbsp;22.3 and 22.5 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement.  In support of its claims, the United States asserted that MOFCOM, in the public  notice of the redetermination, explained neither the matters of fact and law  nor the reasons that led it to maintain anti-dumping and countervailing duties. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">Turning to the specific assertions of the  United&nbsp;States regarding the allegedly inadequate public notice, the Panel  noted that each of these related to aspects of MOFCOM's redetermination that it  found, in its report, to be substantively inconsistent with China's obligations  under the Anti-Dumping Agreement and the SCM Agreement. For that reason,  Panel applied judicial economy and made no findings on these public notice  claims under Article&nbsp;12 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article 22 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement.</p>
