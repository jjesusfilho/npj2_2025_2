        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 13 March 2012, Japan requested consultations with  China with respect to China's restrictions on the export of various forms of  rare earths, tungsten and molybdenum.&nbsp; The request refers to materials falling under  but not limited to 212 eight-digit Chinese Customs Commodity Codes and over 30  measures.&nbsp; The request also refers  to a number of Chinese published as well as unpublished measures that,  operating separately or collectively, allegedly impose and administer export  restrictions. These restrictions include export  duties, export quotas, minimum export price requirements, export  licensing requirements and additional requirements and procedures in connection  with the administration of the quantitative restrictions. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Japan claims that these measures are inconsistent with:</p>

      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 23 July  2012, the DSB established a single panel pursuant to Article 9.1 of the DSU to  examine this dispute, DS431 and DS432.&nbsp;  Brazil, Canada, Colombia, the European Union, India, Korea, Norway,  Oman, Saudi Arabia, Chinese Taipei, the United States and Viet Nam reserved  their third party rights.&nbsp; Subsequently,  Argentina, Australia, Indonesia, Peru, the Russian Federation and Turkey  reserved their third party rights. On 12 September 2012, the United States, the  European Union and Japan requested the Director-General to compose the  panel.&nbsp; On 24 September 2012, the  Director-General composed the panel.

                <p align="left">This dispute concerns Chinese export restrictions on rare earths,  tungsten, and molybdenum. These are raw materials used in the production of  various kinds of electronic goods. China argued that the restrictions are related  to the conservation of its exhaustible natural resources, and necessary to  reduce pollution caused by mining. The complainants disagreed, arguing that the  restrictions are designed to provide Chinese industries that produce downstream  goods with protected access to the subject materials. </p>
                <p align="left">China imposes three distinct types of restrictions on the export of rare  earths, tungsten, and molybdenum: <em>first</em>,  it imposes duties (taxes) on the export of various forms of those materials; <em>second</em>, it imposes an export quota on  the amount of those materials that can be exported in a given period; <em>third</em>, it imposes certain limitations on  the enterprises permitted to export the materials. </p>
                <p><em>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Export  Duties</em></p>
                <p>The complainants alleged that China applies export duties on various  forms of rare earths, molybdenum, and tungsten. The complainants argued that  these duties are inconsistent with China's WTO obligations because in its  Accession Protocol, China undertook to eliminate all export duties, except for  those imposed on a number of products listed in Annex 6 to China's Accession  Protocol. The complainants  argued that, with the exception of tungsten ores and concentrates (which they  excluded from the scope of their claim), none of the products at issue are included in Annex 6, and China is therefore  not entitled to impose the export duties on them. </p>
                <p>China acknowledged that the duties at issue were imposed on products that  are not included in the relevant Annex, but sought to justify its imposition of  export duties on the basis of the &ldquo;General Exceptions&rdquo; provision in  Article XX of the GATT. Specifically, Article XX(b) allows WTO Members to  maintain measures that would otherwise be inconsistent with the GATT 1994 if the  measures are necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health. In  this case, China argued that the export duties are necessary to protect human,  animal and plant life and health from the pollution caused by mining the  products at issue. The complainants argued that the &ldquo;General  Exceptions&rdquo; contained in Article XX of the GATT 1994 are not available to  justify breaches of China's obligation to eliminate export duties contained in  China's Accession Protocol and that, in any event, China's export duties were  not necessary for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health.</p>
                <p>The majority of the Panel agreed with the complainants and found that the  &ldquo;General Exceptions&rdquo; contained in Article XX of the GATT 1994 are not  available to justify a breach of the obligation to eliminate export duties  contained in China's Accession Protocol. Accordingly, the majority held that  China could not invoke the exception in Article XX(b) to seek to justify its  export duties. One panelist disagreed and concluded in a separate dissenting  opinion that the &ldquo;General Exceptions&rdquo; in Article XX of the GATT 1994  are available to justify all WTO obligations related to trade in goods unless  an obligation explicitly provides otherwise, and the relevant obligation in  China's Accession Protocol does not explicitly provide otherwise. </p>
                <p>The Panel nonetheless examined the merits of China's Article XX(b)  defence for its export duties on an <em>arguendo</em> basis so that, in the event of an appeal and reversal on the applicability of  the provision, the Appellate Body would have on the record the Panel's relevant  factual findings in this regard. All of the panelists agreed that even if  Article XX(b) were available to justify China's export duties, those duties  were not &ldquo;necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or  health&rdquo;, as required under Article XX(b). Under the circumstances, China's  imposition of the export duties in question was found to be inconsistent with  China's WTO obligations. </p>
              </ul>
              <ul class="paranormaltext">
                <p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Export Quotas</p>
                <p>China also imposes quantitative limits (quotas) on the amount of rare  earths, tungsten, and molybdenum that can be exported in a given period. Although  it recognized that such restrictions are inconsistent with the GATT 1994, China  argued that they are justified under the exception in Article XX(g) of the GATT  1994, since they relate to the conservation of an exhaustible natural resource. </p>
                <p>The Panel did not agree. It  found that China's export quotas were designed to achieve industrial policy  goals rather than conservation. The Panel agreed with China that the term  &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; in Article XX(g) means more than simply  &ldquo;preservation&rdquo; of natural resources, and that every WTO Member can take  its own sustainable development needs and objectives into account when  designing a conservation policy, in accordance with the general international  law principle of sovereignty over natural resources reflected in various United  Nations and other international instruments. However, the Panel held that  &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; does not allow Members to adopt measures to control  the international market for a natural resource, which is what the challenged  export quotas were, in the view of the Panel, designed to do.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the Panel found  that the challenged export quotas do not work together with measures  restricting domestic Chinese use of rare earths, tungsten, and molybdenum, as  required by the second part of Article XX(g). After examining the various  domestic measures that China claimed restricted domestic access to rare earths,  tungsten, and molybdenum, the Panel concluded that the overall effect of the  foreign and domestic restrictions is to encourage domestic extraction and  secure preferential use of those materials by Chinese manufacturers. Under the  circumstances, the Panel concluded that the &ldquo;even-handedness&rdquo;  required by the Appellate Body under Article XX(g)had not been met, and hence  the quotas could not be justified under that provision.</p>
                <p><em>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trading Rights</em></p>
                <p>China imposes certain restrictions on the right of enterprises to export  rare earths and molybdenum. Although China has committed to eliminating trading  restrictions in its Accession Protocol, it argued that the restrictions in  question are justified pursuant to Article XX(g), since they too relate to the  conservation of exhaustible natural resources. Although the Panel found that  China could rely on the Article XX exceptions to justify the restrictions in question,  it found that China had not satisfactorily explained why its trading rights  restrictions were justified under this provision. Accordingly, the Panel  concluded that China's trading rights restrictions breach its WTO obligations. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p class="paranormaltext">On  25 April 2014, China notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the  Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the panel report and certain  legal interpretations developed by the panel. On the same day, China also  appealed the panel report in dispute DS432. In addition, the United States had  appealed the panel report in dispute DS431 on 8 April 2014, and China filed an  other appeal on 17 April 2014 in the same dispute. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The  Appellate Body consolidated the appellate proceedings in DS431, DS432, and  DS433 before a single Appellate Body Division, harmonized the timetable of the  three appellate proceedings, and held one oral hearing for all three  proceedings. On 24 June 2014, upon expiry of the 60-day period specified in  Article 17.5 of the DSU for DS432 and DS433, the Appellate Body informed the DSB that the Appellate Body Reports in all three  consolidated appeals will be circulated to WTO&nbsp;Members no later than Thursday,  7 August 2014. The Appellate Body issued three Appellate Body Reports in  one single document on 7 August 2014.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">China did not appeal any of the above conclusions of the Panel, but  appealed only limited aspects of the Panel's reasoning and certain intermediate  findings. According to China, its appeal was intended to obtain clarification  of the systemic relationship between specific provisions in China&rsquo;s Accession  Protocol, and other WTO agreements, and of the rights of WTO Members to protect  and conserve their exhaustible natural resources. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">First, China appealed an intermediate Panel finding  in reaching its conclusion that Article&nbsp;XX of the GATT&nbsp;1994 is not  available to justify a breach of Paragraph&nbsp;11.3 of China's Accession  Protocol. China contended that the Panel erred in rejecting China's interpretation  of Paragraph&nbsp;1.2 of China's Accession Protocol and Article XII:1 of  the Marrakesh Agreement as meaning that each provision of China's Accession Protocol is an  integral part of the Marrakesh Agreement or of the Multilateral Trade Agreement  to which that provision &ldquo;intrinsically relates&rdquo;. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body declined to accept China's  interpretation of Paragraph 1.2 of China's Accession Protocol and Article XII:1  of the Marrakesh Agreement, and found that the Panel did not err in rejecting China's  &ldquo;intrinsic relationship&rdquo; test. The Appellate Body found that Article&nbsp;XII:1 of the Marrakesh  Agreement, while providing the generalrule  for acceding to the WTO, does not provide specific guidance on how individual  terms of accession relate to the rights and obligations under the Marrakesh  Agreement and the Multilateral Trade Agreements. The Appellate Body found that  Paragraph&nbsp;1.2 of China's Accession Protocol, which provides that  the Protocol &ldquo;shall be an integral part of the WTO&nbsp;Agreement&rdquo;, serves to build a  bridge between the package of Protocol provisions and the package of existing  WTO rights and obligations. As a result, the  Marrakesh Agreement, the Multilateral Trade Agreements, and China's Accession  Protocol form a single package of rights and obligations that must be read together.  Yet, such interpretation does not in itself answer the questions of  whether there is an objective link between<em> an</em> <em>individual provision</em> in  China's Accession Protocol and existing obligations under the Marrakesh  Agreements and the Multilateral Trade Agreements, or whether China may rely on  an exception provided for in those agreements to justify a breach of such Protocol provision. Such questions must be answered through a thorough analysis  of the relevant provisions on the basis of the customary rules of treaty  interpretation and the circumstances of the dispute. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">Second, China appealed limited  aspects of the Panel's interpretation and application of Article&nbsp;XX(g) of  the GATT 1994, in connection with its findings that the export quotas at issue  are not measures &ldquo;relating to&rdquo; the conservation of exhaustible  natural resources, and are not &ldquo;made effective in conjunction with&rdquo;  restrictions on domestic production or consumption. The Appellate Body found  that, contrary to what China alleged, the Panel did not, either in its  interpretation or in its application of Article&nbsp;XX(g), consider itself  bound to limit its analysis to an  examination of the design and structure of the measures at issue, to the  exclusion of evidence of the effects of China's export quotas. Rather,  the Panel rightly considered that it should focus on the measures' design and  structure rather than on their effects in the marketplace. With respect to the  &ldquo;relating to&rdquo; requirement, the Appellate Body found that the Panel did not err in its reasoning  regarding the signals sent to foreign and domestic consumers by China's export  quotas on rare earths and tungsten, or in rejecting China's argument that, by  virtue of these signalling functions, China's export quotas on rare earths and  tungsten &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; conservation. With respect to the  &quot;made effective in conjunction with&quot; requirement, the Appellate Body  found that the Panel erred to the extent  that it suggested that &ldquo;even-handedness&rdquo; is a separate requirement  that must be fulfilled in addition to the requirements expressly provided for  in Article XX(g), and to the extent that it suggested that Article&nbsp;XX(g)  requires the burden of conservation to be evenly distributed, for instance in  the case of export restrictions, between foreign consumers, on the one hand,  and domestic producers or consumers, on the other hand. However, the Appellate  Body also considered that any such error did not taint the remaining elements  of the Panel's interpretation of the second clause of subparagraph&nbsp;(g). The  Appellate Body also rejected multiple allegations by China that the Panel  failed to comply with its duty, under Article 11 of the DSU, to make an  objective assessment of the matter. Accordingly, the Appellate Body upheld the  Panel's findings that China's export quotas on rare earths, tungsten, and  molybdenum are not justified under Article XX(g) of the GATT 1994. </p>

 <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 29  August 2014, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the panel report, as  upheld by the Appellate Body report. </p>
 <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
 <h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
 <p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 26 September 2014, China  stated that it intended to implement the DSB's recommendations and ruling in a  manner that respects its WTO obligations. China added that it would need a  reasonable period of time to do so. On 8 December 2014, China and Japan  informed the DSB that they had agreed that the  reasonable period of time for China to implement the DSB recommendations and  rulings shall be 8 months and 3 days from the date of adoption of the Appellate  Body and panel reports. Accordingly, the reasonable period of time expired on 2  May 2015.</p>
 <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
 <h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
 <p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 20 May 2015, China informed the  DSB that, according to notices by the  Ministry of Commerce and the General Administration of Customs of China, the  application of export duties and export quotas to rare earths, tungsten and  molybdenum as well as restriction on trading rights of enterprises exporting  rare earths and molybdenum which were found to be inconsistent with WTO rules,  had been removed. In that regard, China had fully implemented the DSB's  recommendations and rulings. </p>
 <p class="paranormaltext"> On 21 May 2015, China and the European Union informed  the DSB of Agreed Procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU. </p>
