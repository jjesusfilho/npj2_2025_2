        <h3>Consultations</h3>
         <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the European Union</strong></p>
        <p align="left">On 15 November 2019, the European Union requested  consultations with Colombia regarding the anti-dumping duties imposed by  Colombia on imports of potatoes, prepared or preserved (otherwise than by  vinegar or acetic acid), frozen (frozen fries), originating in Belgium, the  Netherlands and Germany. </p>
        <p align="left">The European Union claimed that the measures appear  to be inconsistent with:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Articles  1, 2.1, 2.4, 2.4.1, 2.6, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.8,  6.1.2, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.5.1, 6.8, 6.9, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 11.1, 12.2, 12.2.2, 18.1  and paragraphs 3 and 6 of Annex II of the Anti-Dumping Agreement;<br>

         </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Panel  and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p>On 17 February 2020, the European Union requested the  establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 28 February and 5 March 2020, the  DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
        <p>At its meeting on 29 June 2020, the DSB established a panel.  Brazil, China, Honduras, India, Japan, the Russian Federation, T&uuml;rkiye and the  United States reserved their third-party rights.</p>
        <p>On 13 July 2020, the European Union and Colombia informed  the DSB that they had agreed to Procedures for Arbitration under Article 25 of  the DSU in this dispute (&ldquo;Agreed Arbitration Procedures&rdquo;). These procedures,  which were subsequently revised on 20 April 2021, were entered into by the  parties &ldquo;to give effect to communication JOB/DSB/1/Add.12&rdquo; (that is,  the Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement Pursuant To Article 25  Of The DSU (MPIA)) and &ldquo;to decide any appeal from any final panel report  as issued to the parties in [this] dispute.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Following the agreement of the parties, the panel was composed  on 24 August 2020.</p>
        <p>On 31 March 2021, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB  that, taking into account the working procedures and the timetable prepared in  consultation with the parties, including the parties' requests for additional  time to prepare submissions, as well as certain procedural and logistical  challenges presented by the global COVID-19 pandemic the panel did not expect  to issue its final report to the parties before the fourth quarter of 2021.        </p>
        <p>On 29 August 2022, the panel, having consulted with the  parties, adopted Additional Working Procedures to facilitate arbitration under  Article 25 of the DSU (&ldquo;Additional Working Procedures&rdquo;). On the same  day, the panel issued its final report to the parties and informed them that  the panel report would be circulated to Members, following translation, on 19  September 2022.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, the panel received a communication from Colombia  requesting the panel to suspend its work in accordance with Article 12.12 of  the DSU in order to facilitate arbitration under the Agreed Arbitration  Procedures. According to these procedures, Colombia's request constituted a  joint request by both parties. On 16 September 2022, the panel granted the  request effective the same day, and determined not to circulate its final  report to Members unless it was subsequently requested to resume its work  within the time-period specified in Article 12.12 of the DSU.</p>
        <h3>Arbitration under Article 25 of the DSU</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="art25" name="art25"></a>On 6 October 2022, Colombia  filed a notice of recourse to Article 25 under the Agreed Arbitration  Procedures. This notice, which the parties refer to as a &ldquo;Notice of  Appeal&rdquo;, was circulated to the DSB on 10 October 2022. It included the  full text of the final panel report transmitted by the panel to the parties,  third parties and the pool of arbitrators and, absent circulation by the panel  to Members, thereby made the panel report public.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">The  following is a summary of the panel report as included in Colombia's Notice of  Appeal:</p>

      <div aria-labelledby="headingOne" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseA" role="tabpanel">
          <div class="panel-body">
    	    <p>The dispute concerns anti-dumping measures applied by  Colombia on imports of potatoes, prepared or preserved (otherwise than by  vinegar or acetic acid), frozen, classified under tariff subheading  2004.10.00.00 (&ldquo;frozen fries&rdquo;) originating in Belgium, Germany, and  the Netherlands.</p>
            <p>With respect to the <strong>initiation of the investigation</strong>,  the Panel found that Colombia acted inconsistently with Article 5.3 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement because the Colombian investigating authority (MINCIT)  failed to examine whether the use of third-country sales prices, instead of  domestic sales prices, for determining &ldquo;normal value&rdquo; as part of the  initiation was &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; in the specific facts and circumstances  of the underlying investigation. The Panel either rejected or declined to  consider the remainder of the European Union's claims under Article 5.3 challenging  MINCIT's decision to initiate the investigation.</p>
            <p>As to the European Union's challenge against the <strong>confidential  treatment of information</strong> by MINCIT, the Panel found that Colombia acted  inconsistently with Article 6.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement by granting  confidential treatment to certain information in the revised application. The  Panel also found that Colombia acted inconsistently with Article 6.5.1 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement because, <em>inter alia</em>, it failed to  &ldquo;require&rdquo; the applicant to furnish non-confidential summaries of  certain information deemed to be confidential.</p>
            <p>With respect to the European Union's claims concerning  MINCIT's alleged <strong>use of &ldquo;facts available&rdquo;</strong> for calculating  margins of dumping, the Panel found that Colombia acted inconsistently with its  obligations under Article 6.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because MINCIT  disregarded the export prices that the investigated companies had provided in  their questionnaire responses, without determining that the conditions under  Article 6.8 to resort to &ldquo;facts available&rdquo; were satisfied. The Panel  did not consider it necessary to address the European Union's other claims challenging  the use of facts available under paragraphs 3 and 6 of Annex II and Article 2.1  of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.</p>
            <p>The Panel also concluded that Colombia acted inconsistently  with Article 2.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because MINCIT improperly denied  certain <strong>exporters' requests for adjustments</strong> in the dumping calculations.</p>
            <p>As to claims focused on MINCIT's <strong>injury and causation</strong> determinations, the Panel found that Colombia acted inconsistently with  Articles 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, and 3.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, because MINCIT  included in its injury and causation determinations imports from the exporters  that were determined to have final <em>de minimis</em> margins of dumping and  final negative margins of dumping. Given this, the Panel was not called upon to  make further findings on the other grounds presented by the European Union in  support of its claims challenging MINCIT's analysis of the &ldquo;price  effects&rdquo; under Articles 3.2 and 3.1; the impact on the domestic industry  under Articles 3.4 and 3.1; and the causal link under Articles 3.5 and 3.1.</p>

<p>On 12&nbsp;October&nbsp;2022, Members were informed of the  Arbitrators selected for this dispute and the election of the Chair (<a href="javascript:linkdoldoc('WT/DS/591-8.pdf', '')"  data-placement="bottom" data-toggle="tooltip" title="pdf format; opens in a new window">WT/DS591/8</a>).</p>
<p>On 15 November 2022, the hearing in this Arbitration was  held. Pursuant to procedures adopted by the Arbitrators for partial public  viewing of the hearing, opening statements were video recorded for parties and  third parties that waived the confidentiality of their statements.

          <div class="panel-body">
    	    <p>Colombia challenged four findings of inconsistency by the  Panel. With respect to the <strong>initiation  of investigation</strong>, the Arbitrators agreed with the Panel that Colombia's  interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;where appropriate&rdquo; in  Article&nbsp;5.2(iii) was not &ldquo;permissible&rdquo; within the meaning of Article  17.6(ii), but considered that the Panel applied the legal standard in an  overly stringent manner. The Arbitrators considered that an unbiased and objective  authority could have found the use of third-country sales prices in the  application at  issue to be &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; to initiate the investigation. The  Arbitrators therefore reversed the Panel's finding and found that the European  Union had not established that Colombia acted inconsistently with the  obligation under Article 5.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement to determine  the &ldquo;sufficiency&rdquo; of evidence to justify the initiation.</p>
            <p>With respect to MINCIT's <strong>confidential treatment of information</strong>,  the Arbitrators found that the information at issue was &ldquo;provided on a  confidential basis&rdquo; by the applicant and &ldquo;treated&rdquo; by MINCIT as  confidential. The Arbitrators therefore upheld the Panel's finding that, given  the lack of a showing of &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; for the confidential treatment,  MINCIT acted in a manner inconsistent with Article&nbsp;6.5 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement.</p>
            <p>With respect to <strong>exporters' requests for adjustment</strong>, the  Arbitrators disagreed with Colombia that part of the European Union's &ldquo;packaging  cost-related claim&rdquo; under Article&nbsp;2.4 fell outside the Panel's terms  of reference because it was not identified in the panel request. Rather, the  Arbitrators considered that the allegation at issue concerned factual details that  led to Colombia's failure to perform a fair comparison and need not be spelt  out in the panel request. The Arbitrators therefore upheld the Panel's finding that  the claim fell within its terms of reference.</p>
            <p>With respect to MINCIT's<strong> injury and causation </strong>determinations, Colombia contended  that the term &ldquo;dumped imports&rdquo; in Article 3 refers to any imports for  which an authority calculates a positive dumping margin, including <em>de  minimis</em> margins (i.e. less than 2 %). The Arbitrators considered that such  an interpretation would render ineffective the requirement under Article 5.8 to  immediately terminate an investigation where an authority determines a <em>de  minimis</em> dumping margin, and was not supported by other arguments based on  context and negotiating history. The Arbitrators concluded that Colombia's  interpretation was not &ldquo;permissible&rdquo; within the meaning of Article  17.6(ii), and upheld the Panel's finding that Colombia acted inconsistently with  Articles 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </p>

    <h3>Reasonable period of  time</h3>
    <p>
      On  20 January 2023, Colombia  informed the DSB that it intended to implement the arbitrators'  award in a manner that respects its WTO obligations  and that it would need a reasonable period of time to do so. </p>
    <p>On  10 March 2023, Colombia and the European Union informed the DSB that, pursuant to Articles 21.3(b) and 25.4 of the DSU, they had agreed  that the reasonable period of time for Colombia to implement the  recommendations of the arbitrators' award would expire on 5 November 2023.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 10 October 2023, Colombia and the European Union  informed the DSB of Agreed Procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU  (sequencing agreement).</p>

  On  7 December 2023, Colombia informed  the DSB pursuant to Article 21.6 of the DSU of its implementation  of the rulings in the  arbitrators'  award, including the findings of the panel incorprorated  into the arbitrators'  award. Colombia explained that on  21  November 2023, Colombia published Ministerial Resolution 286,  which concluded an administrative review conducted by  Colombia's trade remedies investigating authority.  Colombia explained that, as  set out in the Ministerial Resolution, Colombia revised several aspects of the  original determination subject to this  dispute in order to comply with the adverse findings  concerning the dumping margin calculation, the injury and causation analyses,  as well as confidentiality. Colombia had concluded that the anti-dumping duties  at issue should be continued, on the basis of the modifications made and  applying the reduced dumping margins determined by the investigating authority  in the administrative review. Colombia  submitted that, in the light of the  Ministerial Resolution, it had fully  implemented all of the relevant panel and arbitral findings in  this dispute and had complied with its WTO obligations.  Colombia also stated that it would be pleased to continue to consult with the  European Union on a bilateral basis should the European Union so wish. </p>

<h3>Compliance  proceedings</h3>
<p> On 31 May 2024, the European Union requested  consultations with Colombia pursuant to Article&nbsp;21.5  of the DSU concerning the anti-dumping duties imposed  by Colombia on certain imports of potatoes, prepared or  preserved (otherwise than by vinegar or acetic acid), frozen (frozen fries)  originating from Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.  The European Union stated that the request for consultations was made with  respect to a disagreement as to the existence and consistency  with a covered agreement of measures taken to comply  with the recommendations and rulings in the arbitrators' award, and in the panel  report as modified  by the award. The European Union noted that, pursuant to Article 25.4 of the  DSU, Article 21.5 of the DSU applies <em>mutatis mutandis</em> to the arbitrators'  award in this dispute. </p>
<p align="left">On  14 November 2024, the European Union requested the  establishment of a compliance panel with respect to  measures taken to comply with the recommendations and rulings in the  arbitrators' award, and in the panel report as modified by the award. The  European Union noted that, pursuant to Article 25.4 of the DSU, Article 21.5 of  the DSU applies <em>mutatis mutandis</em> to the arbitrators' award in this  dispute. </p>
<p align="left"> At  its meeting on 25  November 2024,  the DSB agreed to refer to the original panel, if possible, the matter raised  by the European Union. Brazil, China,  Japan, the Russian Federation, T&uuml;rkiye, and the United States  reserved their third-party rights. </p>
<p align="left"> On 27  November 2024, the compliance panel was composed of the original  panelists.</p>
<p>On  25 February 2025, the Chair of the compliance panel informed the DSB that,  in light  of the parties' arguments,  the panel had  granted both parties'  requests to have significantly  more time to file their first written submissions than the time  originally proposed by the panel,  which had  delayed the panel's  substantive work.  Accordingly, the panel  expected  to issue its final report to the parties during the third quarter of 2025.  The Chair apprised the DSB that the  report would be available to the public once it was circulated to the Members  in all three official languages, and that the date of circulation depends on  completion of translation.</p>
