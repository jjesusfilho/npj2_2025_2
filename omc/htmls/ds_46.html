		<h3>Consultations</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Canada. </strong></p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 19   June 1996, Canada  requested consultations with Brazil  under Article 4 of the SCM Agreement, which provides for special procedures for  export subsidies. Canada  claimed that export subsidies granted under the Brazilian Programa de  Financiamento &agrave;s Exporta&ccedil;&otilde;es (PROEX) to foreign purchasers of Brazil&rsquo;s  Embraer aircraft are inconsistent with Articles 3, 27.4 and 27.5 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> Canada requested the establishment of a panel on 16  September 1996, alleging violations of both the SCM Agreement and the GATT  1994. The DSB considered this request at its meeting on 27&nbsp;September 1996.  Due to Brazil&rsquo;s objection to the establishment of a panel, Canada agreed to  modify its request, limiting the scope of the request to the SCM Agreement. The  modified request was submitted by Canada on 3 October 1996 but was subsequently  withdrawn prior to a DSB meeting at which it was to be considered.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 10 July 1998, Canada again requested the  establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 23 July 1998, the DSB established a panel. The European  Communities and the United States reserved their third-party rights. On 16 October 1998, Canada  requested the Director-General to determine the composition of the panel. On 22 October 1998, the panel  was composed. </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> The panel report was circulated to Members on 14 April 1999. The panel  found that Brazil&rsquo;s  measures were inconsistent with Articles 3.1(a) and 27.4 of the SCM Agreement.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 3   May 1999, Brazil  notified its intention to appeal certain issues of law and legal  interpretations developed by the Panel. On 2 August 1999, the Appellate Body report  was circulated to Members. The Appellate Body upheld all the findings of the  panel, but reversed and modified the panel&rsquo;s interpretation of the &ldquo;material  advantage&rdquo; clause in item (k) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies in  Annex I of the SCM Agreement.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 20 August 1999, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report  and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body report, </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 19 November 1999, Brazil announced that it had  withdrawn the measures at issue within 90 days and had thus implemented the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Compliance proceedings</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 23   November 1999, Canada  requested the establishment of a panel under Article 21.5 of the DSU,  requesting that the panel find that Brazil had not taken measures to  comply fully with the rulings and recommendations of the DSB. Canada and Brazil also  notified the DSB of an agreement concerning the procedures to be applicable  pursuant to Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU and Article 4 of the SCM Agreement.  At its meeting on 9 December   1999, the DSB agreed to refer to the original panel pursuant to  Article 21.5 of the DSU. Australia,  the European Communities and the United States reserved their third-party  rights. On 17 December 1999,  the compliance panel was composed.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> The compliance panel report was circulated to Members  on 9 May 2000. The  compliance panel found that Brazil's  measures to comply with the recommendations and rulings of the DSB either did  not exist or were not consistent with the SCM Agreement. In reaching this  conclusion, the compliance panel notably rejected Brazil's defence that PROEX  payments were permitted under item (k) of Annex I of the SCM Agreement, adding  that, if a WTO Member encountered an export credit that had been provided on  terms that it could not meet consistent with the SCM  Agreement, the proper response was to challenge that export credit in WTO  dispute settlement.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 22 May 2000, Brazil notified the DSB of its  intention to appeal certain issues of law and legal interpretations developed  by the compliance panel. </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 21 July 2000, the Appellate Body report was circulated  to Members. The Appellate Body upheld the compliance panel's conclusion that Brazil had  failed to implement the recommendations of the DSB because of the continued  issuance by Brazil  of NTN-I bonds, after 18&nbsp;November  1999, pursuant to letters of commitment issued before 18 November 1999. The Appellate Body  also upheld the compliance panel's findings that payments made under the  revised PROEX are prohibited by Article 3 of the SCM Agreement and are not  justified under item (k) of the Illustrative List of the same Agreement. The  Appellate Body therefore upheld the compliance panel's conclusion that Brazil had  failed to implement the recommendations of the DSB. </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 4 August 2000, the DSB adopted the  Appellate Body report and the compliance panel report, as modified by the  Appellate Body report.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Proceedings under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 10 May 2000, Canada requested authorization from the  DSB to take appropriate countermeasures, pursuant to Article 4.10 of the SCM  Agreement and Article 22.2 of the DSU, in an amount of CanD&nbsp;700 million  per year</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 22 May 2000, Brazil objected to  the level of suspension proposed by Canada and held that the principles and  procedures set out in Article 22.3 have not been followed.&nbsp; Brazil therefore requested the matter be  referred to &nbsp;arbitration, pursuant to  Article 22.6 of the DSU and Article 4.11 of the SCM Agreement. Brazil also  noted that the compliance panel report had not yet been adopted by the DSB and  that, in fact, it had just appealed its findings. The DSB referred the matter  to the original panel for arbitration, it being understood that no  countermeasures would be sought pending the Appellate Body report and until  after the Arbitrator's decision</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 28 August 2000, the Decision of the Arbitrator was  circulated to Members. The Arbitrator found that the appropriate  countermeasures in this case amounted to CanD&nbsp;344.2 million per year. The Arbitrator  found that Canada may request authorization by the DSB to suspend tariff concessions  or other obligations under GATT 1994, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing  and the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures. At the DSB meeting of 12  December 2000, Canada received, pursuant to Article 22.7 of the DSU and Article  4.10 of the SCM Agreement, authorization from the DSB to suspend the  application to Brazil of tariff concessions or other obligations under GATT  1994, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing and the Agreement on Import  Licensing Procedures covering trade in a maximum amount of CanD&nbsp;344.2  million per year. </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 12 December 2000, Brazil informed the DSB of changes  that it had made to the measures at issue in this case and claimed that PROEX  had been brought into compliance with Brazil&rsquo;s obligations under the SCM  Agreement. Canada  was of the view that Brazil  continued to violate its SCM&nbsp;Agreement obligations. Therefore, there was  disagreement between Canada and Brazil as to whether the measures taken by  Brazil to comply with the rulings and recommendations of the DSB bring it into  conformity with the provisions of the SCM Agreement and result in the  withdrawal of the export subsidies to regional aircraft under PROEX.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Compliance proceedings (second recourse)</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> Following the DSB authorization to Canada to impose  countermeasures against Brazil (see above), Brazil announced that it had  revised the interest rate equalization component of PROEX, its export financing  programme related to the sale of regional aircraft, and had, thereby, eliminated  the prohibited export subsidy found in violation of the SCM Agreement by the  original panel, under its new PROEX III scheme. On 22 January 2001, Canada, being  of the view that Brazil continued to violate its SCM Agreement obligations, requested  the DSB to refer the matter again to the original panel, pursuant to Article  21.5 of the DSU. At its meeting of 16 February 2001, the DSB referred the matter to the  original panel. Australia,  the European Communities and Korea  reserved their third-party rights. </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 26 July 2001, the compliance panel report was circulated  to Members. The compliance panel concluded as follows:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">It has not been established that PROEX III as such was inconsistent with Article 3.1(a) of  the SCM Agreement;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">PROEX III  as such is justified under the second paragraph of item (k) of the Illustrative  List of Export Subsidies of Annex I of the SCM  Agreement;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">PROEX III cannot be justified under paragraph 1  of the above-mentioned item. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 23 August 2001, the DSB adopted the compliance  panel report on this second recourse to Article 21.5 of the DSU.</p>
