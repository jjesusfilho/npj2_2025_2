        <p align="left">On 2 April 2019, the European Union requested  consultations with India concerning the tariff treatment that India accords to certain  goods in the information and communications technology sector.</p>
         <p align="left">The European Union claimed that the measures appear  to be inconsistent with: </p>
         <ul>
           <li>Articles II:1(a) and II:1(b) of the GATT 1994. </li>
         </ul>
        <p align="left">On 17 April 2019, Singapore and Chinese  Taipei, requested to join the consultations. On 18 April 2019, Canada, Japan,  Thailand and the United States requested to join the consultations. On 19 April  2019, China requested to join the consultations.</p>

<h3>Panel  and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
<p>On 17 February 2020, the European Union requested the  establishment of a Panel. At its meeting on 28 February and 5 March 2020, the  DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 29 June 2020, the DSB  established a panel. Brazil, Canada, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Norway,  Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, Turkey,  Ukraine and the United States reserved their third-party rights.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 19 August 2020, the European Union  requested the Director-General to compose the panel. On 31 August 2020, the  Director-General composed the panel.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 4 March 2021,  the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that, in accordance with the timetable  adopted following consultations with the parties, the panel In its co estimated that  it would issue its final report to the parties in the  second quarter of 2022. The Chair apprised the DSB that  the report would be available to the public once it was circulated to the  Members in all three official languages, and that the date of circulation  depends on completion of translation.&nbsp;On 29 June  2022, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that  the COVID-19 pandemic and related travel and other restrictions caused further  delays in the proceedings and, as  a result, the panel estimated that it would issue its final  report to the parties not before the end of 2022.&nbsp;On 16 December  2022, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that  due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that the same  panelists have been appointed in this dispute and in two other disputes (DS584  and DS588),  the panel now estimated that it would issue  its final report to the parties in the first quarter of 2023.</p>
           <p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="bkmk582r" name="bkmk582r"></a>On 17 April 2023, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
    	    <p>The European Union challenged the tariff treatment  that India accorded to certain information communications technology (ICT)  products falling under the following tariff items of India's WTO Schedule: 8504.40  ex02; 8517.12; 8517.61; 8517.62; 8517.70 ex01, ex02, and ex03; 8518.30 ex01;  and 8544.42 ex01. </p>
            <p>The European Union claimed that these measures lead,  or led at the time of the Panel's establishment, to the application of ordinary  customs duties in excess of those set forth in India's Schedule of Concessions,  and, therefore, are or were inconsistent with Articles II:1(a) and (b) of the  GATT 1994.</p>
            <p>India argued that: (i) its binding tariff  commitments are set forth in the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), and  those commitments are static and did not change due to their incorporation into  India's WTO Schedule; (ii) pursuant to Article 48 of the Vienna Convention on  the Law of Treaties (Vienna Convention), aspects of India's WTO Schedule are  invalid as a consequence of an error on the part of India during the transposition  of its Schedule from the HS2002 to the HS2007; and (iii) the errors in India's  WTO Schedule are of a formal nature and were therefore capable of rectification  pursuant to the 1980 Decision, such that the European Union's objection to  India's proposed rectification of its Schedule is inconsistent with the  requirements of the 1980 Decision. India also raised several arguments  concerning the nature of the conditions attached to certain tariff treatment,  as well as the tariff classification of certain products.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>General issues concerning India's WTO tariff commitments</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Panel rejected India's  assertions that its binding tariff commitments are set forth in the ITA, and  found that: (i) the ITA is not a covered agreement within the meaning of the WTO  Agreement and the DSU; and (ii) the ITA is not the source of India's legal  obligations in these disputes. The Panel also held that India's WTO tariff  commitments are not static in nature.</li>
              <li>The Panel further found that India  did not satisfy the requirements of Article 48 of the Vienna Convention. The  Panel accepted in good faith India's argument that at the time of the  transposition of its HS2002 Schedule into its HS2007 Schedule, India had assumed  that the scope of its WTO commitments was limited to the scope of its ITA  undertakings and that the scope of those tariff commitments would not be  expanded through the HS2007 transposition process. However, the Panel found  that India had failed to demonstrate that this assumption constituted an  essential basis of India's consent to be bound by the certified Schedule. The  Panel also found that India was put on notice of the possibility that its WTO  tariff commitments in its HS2007 Schedule may have expanded from those set  forth in its HS2002 Schedule, and similarly, that its WTO tariff commitments in  its HS2007 Schedule may have expanded from those set forth in the ITA. Thus,  even if Article 48 applied in WTO dispute settlement (which the Panel did not  consider it necessary to address), the circumstances did not satisfy the  requirements of Articles 48(1) and (2) of the Vienna Convention. </li>
              <li>The Panel further declined to make  findings on India's request that the Panel find that the European Union violated  paragraph 3 of the 1980 Decision by raising objections to India's requested  rectification unfounded in law, and thereby impeded India's rights to make a  formal rectification to its schedule of concessions under the 1980 Decision.  The Panel found that India's requests were claims, not affirmative defences,  and therefore fell outside the Panel's terms of reference. The Panel also  considered that, even if it made findings on this issue, to the extent that  there remained objections on record to India's rectification request (including  those by WTO Members who were not parties to this dispute), India's WTO  Schedule would remain unmodified, and the findings requested by India would not  modify India's WTO obligations as set forth in its WTO Schedule. </li>
              <li>Thus, the Panel found that India's  WTO tariff commitments, for purposes of applying Articles II:1(a) and (b) of  the GATT 1994, are set forth in its WTO Schedule.</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left"><strong>Articles II:1(a)  and (b) of the GATT 1994</strong></p>
            <p>The Panel found that: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>India's tariff treatment of products falling under tariff  items 8504.40 ex02, 8517.12, 8517.61, 8517.62, and 8517.70 ex01, ex02, and ex03  of India's WTO Schedule is inconsistent with Article II:1(b), first sentence,  because: (i) certain such products are subject to ordinary customs duties in  excess of those set forth in India's WTO Schedule; and (ii) certain such  products are subject to ordinary customs duties in excess of those set forth in  India's WTO Schedule unless they satisfy certain conditions that are not set  forth in that WTO Schedule. The Panel also found that India's tariff treatment  of such products is less favourable than that provided in its WTO Schedule, such  that India is acting inconsistently with Article II:1(a) of the GATT 1994.</li>
              <li>At the time of the Panel's establishment, India's  tariff treatment of products falling under tariff items 8518.30 ex01 and  8544.42 ex01 was inconsistent with Article II:1(b), first sentence, because  certain such products were subject to ordinary customs duties in excess of  those set forth and provided in India's WTO Schedule unless they satisfied  certain conditions not set forth in that WTO Schedule. The Panel also found  that India's tariff treatment of such products was less favourable than that  provided in its WTO Schedule, such that India was acting inconsistently with  Article II:1(a) of the GATT 1994.</li>
              <li>As of 1 February 2022, India accords unconditional  duty-free treatment to products falling under tariff items 8518.30 ex01; and  8544.42 ex01, in accordance with the terms of its WTO Schedule, and is therefore  acting consistently with Article II:1(b), first sentence, of the GATT 1994. The  Panel also found that by according to the commerce of the European Union  treatment no less favourable than that provided for in its WTO Schedule,  India's tariff treatment of such products is consistent with Article II:1(a) of  the GATT 1994.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>On  2 June 2023, the European Union and India requested the DSB to adopt a decision  that, upon a request by either party, the DSB shall no later than 19 September  2023 adopt the report of the panel in this dispute unless (i) the DSB decides  by consensus not to do so or (ii) either party to the dispute notifies the DSB  of its decision to appeal pursuant to Article 16.4 of the DSU. Any such  adoption or appeal of the panel report would be deemed to have occurred within  the 60-day time period specified in Article 16.4 of the DSU. At  its meeting on 15 June 2023, as jointly requested  by the parties, the DSB agreed to  provide the additional time for the adoption or appeal of the panel report. At its meeting of 19 September 2023, in response to a  joint request from the parties dated 5 September 2023, the DSB extended the  deadline for the adoption or appeal of the panel report to 18 December 2023.</p>
<p>On 8 December  2023, India notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body  certain issues of law and legal interpretations in the panel report.  On 11 December 2023, in a communication circulated  to the DSB, the European Union  indicated that,  given that the Appellate  Body remained non-operational, the European Union considered  that all subsequent procedural  deadlines set out in the Appellate Body's Working Procedures were to be considered as suspended. The  European Union indicated its  intention to file a written submission in this appeal within  the deadline to be determined by the Appellate Body once it resumes its  functions, and to participate and  make oral statements at the hearing to be convened by the Appellate Body. The  European Union also  noted that it disagreed  with all of India's  allegations of errors of law and legal interpretation in the panel  report.</p>
