 <h3>Consultations</h3>
    <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the European Communities. </strong></p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 12   June 2003, the European Communities requested consultations with  the United States  concerning a methodology used by the US, among others, in the  calculation of dumping margins, known as &ldquo;zeroing&rdquo;. The &ldquo;zeroing&rdquo; methodology,  generally speaking, involves treating specific price comparisons which do not  show dumping as zero values in the calculation of a weighted average dumping  margin.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The request concerned specific provisions of the US  Tariff Act of 1930 and the Department of Commerce implementing regulation as  well as US Department of Commerce methodology and its determinations in  specific cases involving products imported from the European Communities.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The European Communities indicated specific aspects of  the zeroing methodology that it would raise in the consultations, including the  way in which it was applied in calculating dumping margins, its impact on  determinations of injury, its impact in cases which would otherwise be <em>de  minimis</em>, and the level of the dumping margins in 21 specific US anti-dumping  cases.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The European Communities attached to its request  details of those specific cases, alleging that in each of them the United States  used zeroing methodology. Most of the products in these cases were steel. The European  Communities asserted that in each case the dumping margin without zeroing would  have been lower, <em>de minimis</em> or negative. In the European Communities&rsquo;  view, the Act, regulation, methodology and these specific determinations appear  to be inconsistent with the United    States&rsquo; obligations under the following WTO  provisions:</p>
    <ul class="paranormaltext">
      <li class="paranormaltext">Articles 1, 2.4, 3, 5.8, 9.3, 9.5, 11, 18.3 and  18.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement;<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994;<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">Article XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 27   June 2003, India  and Korea  requested to join the consultations. On 30 June 2003, Japan and Mexico  requested to join the consultations.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 8   September 2003, the European Communities requested further  consultations with the United&nbsp;States. The European Communities wished to  add ten more cases to the list of specific cases.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The European Communities indicated specific aspects of  the zeroing methodology that it will raise in the additional consultations,  including the way in which it is applied in calculating dumping margins, its  impact on determinations of injury, its impact in cases which would otherwise  be <em>de&nbsp;minimis</em>, and the level of the dumping margins in specific US anti-dumping  cases.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> In the European Communities&rsquo; view, these additional  specific determinations appear to be inconsistent with the US obligations  under the same WTO provisions mentioned above.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 25   September 2003, Mexico  requested to join the consultations.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 5   February 2004, the European Communities requested the establishment  of a panel. On 16&nbsp;February 2004, the European Communities submitted a  revised request for the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 17 February 2004, the DSB  deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 19 March 2004, the DSB established a panel. Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Norway and  Chinese Taipei reserved their third-party rights. On 23 March 2004, Hong Kong, China  reserved its third-party right. On 30 March 2004, Turkey reserved its third-party  right. On 27 October 2004,  the panel was composed.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 22   March 2005, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that it  would not be possible for the panel to complete its work in six months in light  of the schedule which had been agreed after consultations with the parties, and  that the panel expected to complete its work in July 2005. On 1&nbsp;July 2005,  the panel informed the DSB that&nbsp;due to its continued consideration of the  issues in this dispute, it would not be possible for the panel to complete its  work by the end of July, and that the panel expected to complete its work in  September 2005. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 31   October 2005, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>
    <ul class="paranormaltext">
      <li class="paranormaltext">The panel unanimously upheld the claims of the  European Communities as they relate to the specific determinations of dumping  made by the United States Department of Commerce in the 15 original  investigations at issue. The panel also unanimously upheld the claims of the  European Communities in respect of what was described by the panel as the United States  &ldquo;methodology&rdquo; of zeroing in original investigations. In doing so, the panel  found that the United States  &ldquo;methodology&rdquo; of zeroing was a &ldquo;norm&rdquo; capable of being challenged in WTO  dispute settlement proceedings.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The panel unanimously rejected the claims of the  European Communities with respect to United States law, finding that the  provisions in question did not speak to the issue of zeroing.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The panel rejected all of the claims of the  European Communities in the context of reviews of existing measures. However,  one member of the panel dissented from this aspect of the panel&rsquo;s findings. The  dissenting member of the panel would have upheld the claims of the European  Communities as they relate to the 16 specific determinations of dumping in  reviews as well as the United    States &ldquo;methodology&rdquo; of zeroing in the  context of reviews. The dissenting member of the panel would also have found  one provision of a United    States regulation to be WTO-inconsistent in  respect of reviews.<br />
&nbsp; </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The panel recommended that the DSB request the United States  to bring its measures into conformity with its obligations under the Anti-Dumping  Agreement. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting of 6 December 2005, following a joint request by  the parties, the DSB agreed to extend the time period for the adoption of the  panel report until 31   January 2006.&nbsp; On 17 January 2006, the European Communities notified its  decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the  panel report and certain legal interpretations developed by the panel.&nbsp; On  30&nbsp;January 2006, the United    States notified its decision to appeal to  the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the panel report and certain  legal interpretations developed by the panel. On 15&nbsp;March 2006, the  Chairman of the Appellate Body informed the DSB that it would not be able to  circulate its report within the 60-day period due to the time required for  completion and translation of the report, and that it estimated it would be  circulated to WTO Members no later than 18 April 2006.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 18   April 2006, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members. </p>
    <ul class="paranormaltext">
      <li class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body found that the zeroing  methodology, as it relates to original investigations in which the  weighted-average-to-weighted-average comparison method is used to calculate  margins of dumping, can be challenged, as such, in WTO dispute settlement and  upheld the panel's conclusion that this methodology is inconsistent, as such,  with Article&nbsp;2.4.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">With respect to the administrative reviews at  issue, the Appellate Body reversed the panel's finding that the United States  did not act inconsistently with Article&nbsp;9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement  and Article&nbsp;VI:2 of the GATT 1994, and found, instead, that the United  States acted inconsistently with those provisions.&nbsp; The Appellate Body further found it  unnecessary to rule on whether the United States acted inconsistently with the  first sentence of Article 2.4 of the &nbsp;Anti-Dumping Agreement; upheld the  panel's finding that zeroing is not an impermissible allowance or adjustment  under Article&nbsp;2.4 of the &nbsp;Anti-Dumping Agreement, third to fifth  sentences; declined to rule on the European Communities' conditional appeal  under Article 2.4.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement<em>,</em> and upheld the panel's finding that the United States did not act  inconsistently with Articles 11.1 and 11.2 of the &nbsp;Anti-Dumping Agreement.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body found it unnecessary to rule  on whether the zeroing methodology, as applied in the administrative reviews at  issue, is inconsistent with Articles&nbsp;1 and 18 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement and Article&nbsp;XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement<em>,</em> and declared moot the panel's findings that the United States did  not act inconsistently with Article VI:1 of the GATT 1994 and the first  sentence of Article&nbsp;2.4 of the&nbsp;Anti-Dumping Agreement.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body declared moot the panel's  finding that the zeroing methodology, as it relates to administrative reviews,  is not inconsistent, as such, with Articles 1, 2.4, 2.4.2, 9.3, 11.1, 11.2, and  18.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994 and  Article XVI:4 of the &nbsp;WTO Agreement.&nbsp;  The Appellate Body further determined that it was unable to complete the  analysis to determine whether the zeroing methodology, as it relates to  administrative reviews, is inconsistent, as such, with these provisions.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body further found that the  Standard Zeroing Procedures are not a measure than can be challenged, as such,  and, accordingly, declared moot the panel's finding that the Standard Zeroing  Procedures are not inconsistent, as such, with Articles 1, 2.4, 2.4.2, 9.3,  11.1, 11.2, and 18.4 of the&nbsp;Anti-Dumping Agreement, Articles VI:1 and VI:2  of the GATT 1994 and Article&nbsp;XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement;<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body also found that the panel did  not err in exercising judicial economy by not making findings with regard to  whether the Anti-Dumping Manual is a measure that is inconsistent, as such,  with Articles&nbsp;1, 2.4, 2.4.2, 5.8, 9.3, 9.5, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, and 18.4 of  the&nbsp;Anti-Dumping Agreement, Articles&nbsp;VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994,  and Article&nbsp;XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement, whether administrative review  proceedings based on model zeroing are inconsistent with Article 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement,and whether zeroing  &ldquo;as applied&rdquo; in the original investigations at issue is inconsistent  with Article&nbsp;2.4 of the &nbsp;Anti-Dumping Agreement.&nbsp; The Appellate Body also declined to rule on  the European Communities' conditional appeal regarding the United States'  &ldquo;practice&rdquo; of zeroing.<br />
&nbsp;        &nbsp; </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body declared moot the panel's  finding that Section&nbsp;351.414(c)(2) is not inconsistent, as such, with  Articles&nbsp;1, 2.4, 2.4.2, 9.3, 9.5, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, and&nbsp;18.4 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement, Articles&nbsp;VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994, and Article&nbsp;XVI:4  of the WTO Agreement and declined to complete the analysis on these  issues.<br />
&nbsp;        &nbsp; </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">Finally, the Appellate Body rejected the European  Communities' claim that the panel acted inconsistently with its obligations  under Article 11 of the DSU by failing to make an objective assessment of the  matter before it, including an objective assessment of the facts of the case.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body recommended that the DSB request the  United States to bring its measures into conformity with its obligations under  the&nbsp;Anti-Dumping Agreement and the GATT 1994.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 9   May 2006, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the panel  report, as modified by the Appellate Body report.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Compliance proceedings</h3>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The European Communities considered that there was a  disagreement as to the existence or consistency with a covered agreement of the  measures taken to comply with the rulings and recommendations of the DSB.  Therefore, on 9 July 2007,  the European Communities requested consultations under Article&nbsp;21.5.  Brazil and Korea  requested to join the consultations. On 13&nbsp;September 2007, the European  Communities requested the establishment of a compliance panel. At its meeting  on 25 September 2007,  the DSB agreed to refer, if possible, the matter raised by the European  Communities to the original panel. India, Japan and Mexico reserved  their third-party rights. Subsequently, Korea, Norway, Chinese Taipei and Thailand  reserved their third-party rights. On 28 November 2007, the European Communities requested the  Director-General to compose the compliance panel. On 30 November 2007, the  Director-General composed the compliance panel. On 26 May 2008, the Chairman of the compliance panel  informed the DSB that it would not be able to circulate its report within 90  days after the date of referral given the delays in the composition of the compliance  panel and the schedule adopted after consultations with the parties. The compliance  panel expected to complete its work in October 2008.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 17   December 2008, the compliance panel report was circulated to  Members.&nbsp; The compliance panel first found that it had no authority to  make findings with respect to the European Communities' claim that the compliance  panel was improperly constituted under Articles&nbsp;8.3 and 21.5 of the DSU. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> With respect to its terms of reference: </p>
    <ul class="paranormaltext">
      <li class="paranormaltext">The compliance panel rejected the argument by  the European Communities that subsequent reviews fell within the compliance  panel's terms of references as &ldquo;amendments&rdquo; to the measures at issue  in the original dispute.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The compliance panel considered that measures  not characterized by the implementing Member as measures &ldquo;taken to  comply&rdquo; may nevertheless fall within a compliance panel's terms of  reference when they share a sufficiently close connection with the measures at  issue in the original proceedings, or with the DSB's recommendations and  rulings. The compliance panel found that a sufficiently close nexus existed, in  terms of their nature and effects between subsequent reviews and the measure at  issue in the original dispute, and the DSB's recommendations and rulings. The  compliance panel ruled that successive determinations made in the context of a  single anti-dumping duty order formed part of a continuum of events and are  measures that are all inextricably linked.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The compliance panel found that as a matter of  logic, measures taken before the adoption of the DSB's recommendations and  rulings could not be found to be measures taken to comply with those  recommendations and rulings. Conversely, only the subsequent review  determinations made after the adoption of the DSB's recommendations and rulings  had a sufficiently close link with those recommendations, and with the steps  taken, if any, by the implementing Member to achieve compliance. On this basis,  the compliance panel found each of the subsequent reviews decided after the  adoption of the DSB's recommendations and rulings but none decided prior to  that date, to fall within its terms of reference.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paranormaltext">Applying these principles, the compliance panel found  that nine specific subsequent administrative reviews and five subsequent sunset  reviews fell within its terms of reference.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> With respect to the claims by the European Communities  that &nbsp;the United States failed to fully  implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in the original dispute,  the compliance panel found that: </p>
    <ul class="paranormaltext">
      <li class="paranormaltext">The United States failed to comply with the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB in the original dispute and acted  inconsistently with Article&nbsp;9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and  Article&nbsp;VI:2 of the GATT 1994 by determining, after the end of the  reasonable period of time, the amount of anti-dumping duty to be assessed based  on zeroing in the 2004-2005 administrative review in case 1 (Hot Rolled Steel  from the Netherlands) and issuing assessment instructions pursuant to that  determination and by determining, after the end of the reasonable period of  time, the amount of anti-dumping duty to be assessed based on zeroing in the  2004-2005 administrative review in case 6 (Stainless Steel Wire Rod from  Sweden) and issuing assessment instructions pursuant to that determination.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The United States failed to comply with the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB in the original dispute by continuing to  apply to imports of NSK cash deposit rates established in the 2000-2001  administrative review in case 31 (Ball Bearings from the United Kingdom), a  measure which was found to be inconsistent with Articles&nbsp;9.3 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and VI:2 of the GATT 1994 in the original dispute.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The United States had not failed to comply with  the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in the original dispute by taking  actions to liquidate anti-dumping duties calculated with zeroing pursuant to  final duty assessment determinations made before the end of the reasonable  period of time (including pursuant to subsequent administrative reviews listed  in the Annex to the European Communities' Article&nbsp;21.5 panel request).<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The United States had not failed to comply with  the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in the original dispute by  determining, prior to the end of the reasonable period of time, the amount of  anti-dumping duty to be assessed based on zeroing in the 2005-2006  administrative review determination in case 1 (Hot Rolled Steel from the  Netherlands).<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The United States had not failed to comply with  the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in the original dispute and has not  acted inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;2.4.2 and 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement and Article&nbsp;VI:2 of the GATT 1994 by establishing a new cash  deposit rate based on zeroing in the 2004-2005 administrative review  determination in case 6 (Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Sweden) because due to  the revocation of the measure in question, no cash deposit requirement was  actually imposed.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">None of the sunset reviews within the panel's  terms of reference and with respect to which the European Communities made  claims, had, by the time of the establishment of the panel, resulted in the  continuation of the concerned anti-dumping orders. Thus, the panel made no  findings in respect of the claims of the European Communities that the United  States violated Articles&nbsp;2.1, 2.4, 2.4.2 and 11.3 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement as a result of having relied on margins of dumping calculated with  zeroing in the context of sunset reviews involving measures challenged in the  original dispute.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The panel made no findings with respect to the European  Communities' claim that the United States violated Articles&nbsp;21.3 and  21.3(b) of the DSU by failing to take any measure to comply between 9 April and  23 April/31 August 2007. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paranormaltext">With respect to the European Communities' claims that  certain US measures taken to comply were inconsistent with the US obligations  under the covered agreements, the compliance panel made no finding with respect  to Section 129 determination in case 11, which it had found was not properly  before it; the European Communities' claims under Article&nbsp;5.8 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article&nbsp;VI:I of the GATT 1994 in respect of  cases 2, 3, 4 and 5; and the European Communities' claims under  Article&nbsp;6.8 and Annex II of the Anti-Dumping Agreement in respect of cases  2, 4 and 5. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The compliance panel further found that, to the extent  that the measures taken by the United&nbsp;States to comply with the  recommendations and rulings adopted by the DSB in the original proceeding were  inconsistent with the obligations of the United States under the covered agreements,  and to the extent that the United States had otherwise failed to implement the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB in the original dispute, these  recommendations and rulings of the DSB remained operative. It therefore made no  new recommendation.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 13   February 2009, the European Communities notified the DSB of its  decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the  compliance panel report and certain legal interpretations developed by the  compliance panel.&nbsp; On 25 February 2009, the United States  notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues  of law covered in the compliance panel report and certain legal interpretations  developed by the compliance panel.&nbsp; On 9 April 2009, the Chairman of  the Appellate Body informed the DSB that due to the time required for  completion and translation of the Appellate Body report, the Appellate Body  would not be able to circulate its report within 60 days.&nbsp; It is estimated that the Appellate Body  report would be circulated on 14   May 2009.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 14   May 2009, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members. &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">
      The Appellate Body found that the compliance panel did  not err in refraining from making a finding on whether it was improperly  composed&nbsp; under Articles 8.3 and 21.5 of  the DSU. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> With respect to the compliance panel's terms of  reference: </p>
    <ul class="paranormaltext">
      <li class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body upheld the compliance panel's  finding that the subsequent reviews identified in the European Communities'  panel request did not fall within the terms of reference under Article 21.5 of  the DSU as &ldquo;amendments&rdquo; to the original measures at issue.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">However the Appellate Body reversed the compliance  panel's finding that the subsequent reviews that pre-dated the adoption of the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB did not fall within the panel's terms of  reference and found instead, that five sunset reviews (in Cases 24, 28, 29, 30  and 31) had a sufficiently close nexus with the declared measures &ldquo;taken  to comply&rdquo;, and with the recommendations and rulings of the DSB so as to  fall within the scope of the Article 21.5 proceedings.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body upheld the compliance panel's  findings that the 2004-2005 administrative reviews in Cases 1 and 6 fell within  the panel's terms of reference. In a separate opinion, one Appellate Body  Member reached the conclusion that these reviews did not fall within the scope  of the Article 21.5 proceedings and considered it inappropriate to make further  findings with respect to Cases 1 and 6.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On the appealed issues relating to the claims by the  European Communities that the United States failed to fully implement the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB in the original dispute: </p>
    <ul class="paranormaltext">
      <li class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body upheld, with respect to Cases  1 and 6, the compliance panel findings that the United States acted  inconsistently with Article&nbsp;9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and  Article&nbsp;VI:2 of the GATT 1994 by issuing, after the end of the reasonable  period of time, the 2004-2005 administrative review determinations, consequent  assessment instructions, or liquidation instructions reflecting zeroing. As a  result, the United States failed to comply with the recommendations and rulings  of the DSB to bring these original investigations into conformity.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">Regarding Case 31, the Appellate Body found that  the compliance panel erred in refraining from making a finding on an assessment  made after the end of the reasonable period of time of duty liability for  imports from NSK Bearings Europe Ltd., and that duties assessed after the end  of that period on the basis of cash deposit rates reflecting zeroing establish  a failure in compliance by the United States. Additionally, given the  insufficient undisputed facts on record, the Appellate Body was not in a  position to complete the analysis in relation to Cases 18 through 24 and 27  through 30, and declined to rule on whether the compliance panel erred by not  making findings in relation to those cases. However, the Appellate Body agreed  that the United States fails to comply if it continues to apply cash deposits  on the basis of zeroing after the end of the reasonable period of time in  respect of those Cases.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body reversed the compliance panel's  finding that the assessment and liquidation instructions consequent to the  rescission of the 2005-2006 administrative review in Case 1 did not establish a  failure to comply by the United States.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">With respect to the sunset reviews: the  Appellate Body upheld the compliance panel's finding that the United States did  not fail to comply with the DSB's recommendations and rulings in respect of the  subsequent sunset reviews in Cases 2,3, 4 and 5, considering that these sunset  reviews resulted in revocation orders, effective as from before the end of the  reasonable period of time. The Appellate Body however reversed the compliance panel's  findings that the United States did not fail to comply in respect of the sunset  review in Case&nbsp;19, and found instead that, in relation to Case 19, the  United States acted inconsistently with Article 11.3 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement and failed to comply with the recommendations and rulings of the DSB.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body also found that the United  States acted inconsistently with Article 11.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and  failed to comply in relation to the sunset reviews in Cases 28, 29, 30 and 31.<br />
&nbsp;      </li>
      <li class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body found that the compliance panel  did not act inconsistently with Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU in declining to make  findings on the European Communities' claim that the United States violated  Articles&nbsp;21.3 and 21.3(b) of the DSU by not taking measures to comply  between 9 April and 23 April/31 August 2007. The Appellate Body underscored  however, that the responding Member is expected to comply, at the latest, by  the end of the reasonable period of time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paranormaltext">With respect to the Section 129 determination in Case  11, the Appellate Body reversed the compliance panel's finding that the  European Communities could not raise claims in the Article&nbsp;21.5  proceedings with respect to an alleged error in the calculation of dumping  margins, because it could have raised them in the original proceedings but  failed to do so. The Appellate Body however, was unable to complete the  analysis on whether the alleged arithmetic error was separable from, or an  integral part of, the measure taken to comply and on whether the European  Communities could raise such claims in the Article 21.5 proceedings. The  Appellate Body therefore did not rule on whether the United States failed to  comply by not correcting such alleged error in the Section 129 determination in  Case 11. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body found it unnecessary to make  findings on the European Communities' claim that the United States acted  inconsistently with Article 9.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement in the  establishment of the &ldquo;all others&rdquo; rates in the Section 129 determinations  in Cases 2, 4 and 5. However, the Appellate Body disagreed with the compliance  panel's interpretation that Article 9.4 imposes no obligations when all margins  of investigated exporters are zero <em>de  minimis</em>, or based on &ldquo;facts available&rdquo;. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body also found that the compliance panel  did not err in making findings in respect of the European Communities' claims  under Article 6.8 and Annex II of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> Finally, the Appellate Body declined the European  Communities' request for a suggestion on how the United States could implement  the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in this dispute.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 11 June 2009, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body  report and the compliance panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body  report.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Proceedings under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 29   January 2010, the European Union requested the DSB for  authorization to suspend the application of concessions or other obligations  under the covered agreements pursuant to Article&nbsp;22.2 of the DSU. On 12 February 2010, the United States  informed the DSB that, pursuant to Article 22.6 of the DSU, it objected to the  level of suspension of concessions or other obligations proposed by the  European Union and also claimed that the European Union's proposal did not  follow the principles and procedures set forth in Article 22.3 of the DSU.&nbsp; At its meeting on 18&nbsp;February&nbsp;2010, the DSB agreed  that the matter raised by the United    States was referred to arbitration.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 7 September 2010, the European Union and the  United States jointly requested the Arbitrator to suspend its work, in the  context of informal discussions with respect to implementation.&nbsp; On the basis of this request, the Arbitrator  decided to suspend its work.&nbsp; As  requested by the parties, the suspension would be limited to 12 months less one  day. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 7 September 2011, the European Union and the  United States jointly requested the Arbitrator to suspend its work for a  further period of four months and two days, until 6 January 2012.&nbsp; On 6 January 2012, 13 January 2012 and 6&nbsp;February  2012, the European Union and the United States jointly requested the Arbitrator  to suspend its work for a further periods.&nbsp;  The suspension will be limited to 28 June 2012, and absent any  &ldquo;contrary written communication&rdquo; from the European Union within that  period, the suspension will be automatically terminated and the work of the Arbitrator  will resume on 29 June&nbsp;2012.&nbsp; The  last date at which a &ldquo;contrary written communication&rdquo; may be received  by the Arbitrator is 28 June 2012.&nbsp; In  the event of no such &ldquo;contrary written communication&rdquo; or written  request for resumption from either party has been received by the Arbitrator by  28 June 2012, it will resume its work on 29&nbsp;June 2012 and circulate its  Decision on 12 July 2012.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 6 February 2012, the European Union and the  United States informed the DSB of a Memorandum between the United States and  the European Commission which envisages a roadmap addressing this dispute.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 22 June 2012, the European Union withdrew its  request for authorization from the Dispute Settlement Body to suspend the  application of concessions or other obligations under the covered agreements  pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU.&nbsp; The  withdrawal followed the completion by the United States of the steps undertaken  pursuant to the roadmap notified to the DSB in February&nbsp;2012.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 2 July 2012, the Chairman of the Arbitrator  informed the DSB that the Arbitrator had received a joint communication dated  22 June 2012 from the European Union and the United States in which they stated  that as the European Union had withdrawn is request under Article 22.2 of the  DSU, the United States accordingly no longer made objections under Article 22.6  of the DSU.&nbsp; Therefore, the United States  and the European Union requested the Arbitrator to notify the DSB that it was  not necessary for it to issue a report/an award in this dispute. Pursuant to this joint &nbsp;communication, the Arbitrator considered that  it was not necessary for it to issue a decision on the matter referred to it.  The Arbitrator therefore considered that it had completed its work.</p></div>
