        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Argentina.&nbsp; (See also <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds291_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS291</a> and <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds292_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS292</a>) </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 14 May 2003,  Argentina requested  consultations with the EC concerning certain measures taken by the EC and its member   States affecting imports of  agricultural and food imports from Argentina.  Regarding EC-level measures, Argentina  asserted that the moratorium applied by the EC since October 1998 on the  approval of biotech products has restricted imports of agricultural and food  products from Argentina.  Regarding member State-level measures, Argentina  asserted that a number of EC member States maintain national marketing and  import bans on biotech products even though those products have already been  approved by the EC for import and marketing in the EC. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> According to Argentina,  the measures at issue appeared to be inconsistent with the EC&rsquo;s obligations  under:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
               <li>Articles 2, 5, 7, 8 and 10, and Annexes B and C  of the SPS Agreement;<br>
&nbsp;               </li>
               <li>Article&nbsp;4 of the Agriculture  Agreement;<br>
&nbsp;               &nbsp; </li>
               <li>Articles I, III,  X and XI of the GATT 1994; and<br>
               &nbsp; </li>
               <li>Articles 2, 5 and 12 of the TBT Agreement. </li>
             </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Australia,  Brazil, Canada,  India, Mexico,  New Zealand and  the United States  requested to join the consultations. The EC informed the DSB that they had  accepted the requests of Australia,  Brazil, Canada,  India, Mexico,  New Zealand and  the United States  to join the consultations.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 7 August   2003, Argentina  requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 18 August 2003, the DSB deferred the  establishment of a panel. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 29 August 2003, the DSB established a single panel to  examine this dispute and disputes DS291 and DS292. Australia,  Brazil, Canada,  Chile, China,  Colombia, El    Salvador, Honduras,  Mexico, New    Zealand, Norway,  Paraguay, Peru,  Chinese Taipei, Thailand,  Uruguay and the  United States  reserved their third-party rights.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 23 February   2004, the United States,  Canada and Argentina  jointly requested the Director-General to compose the panel. On 4 March 2004, the Director-General  composed the panel. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 12 July   2004, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that it would not  be able to complete its work in six months, due, inter alia, to the  parties&rsquo; common request for additional time to prepare their rebuttals. On 18  August 2004, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that that the panel  estimated that it would issue its final report to the parties by the end of  March 2005, and that the delay was due to the parties&rsquo; common request for  additional time to prepare their rebuttals as well as the panel&rsquo;s decision to  seek scientific and technical expert advice pursuant to Article&nbsp;11 of the Agreement  on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and Article&nbsp;13 of the DSU. On 2  November 2004, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that as a result of  the time taken to identify and select experts and, more importantly, in view of  a joint request by all four parties that they be granted additional time to  prepare their further submissions to the panel, it would not be possible for  the panel to issue its final report to the parties by the end of March 2005,  and that&nbsp;the panel estimated that it would issue its final report to the  parties by the end of June 2005. On 13&nbsp;June   2005, the panel informed the DSB that the panel estimated that it  would issue its final report to the parties by the end of October 2005. On 11 August 2005, the panel estimated  that it would issue its final report to the parties by the end of December 2005.  On 21 December 2005, the  Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that the panel required additional time  to prepare and finalize its report.&nbsp; The panel estimated that it would  issue its final report to the parties be the end of March 2006. On 30 March 2006, the Chairman of the panel  informed the DSB that it would not be possible to issue its final reports to  the parties at the end of March 2006 as the panel had yet to receive, in the  second half of April, further comments from the parties on its interim reports.  The panel estimated that it would issue its final reports to the parties by  mid-May 2006 and that the final reports would be circulated to Members no later  than the end of September 2006. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 29   September 2006, the panel reports were circulated to Members.&nbsp;  The panel found that the European Communities applied a general de facto moratorium on the approval of  biotech products between June 1999 and August 2003, which is when the panel was  established.&nbsp; Before the panel, the European Communities had categorically  denied the existence of such a moratorium. The panel further found that, by  applying this moratorium, the European Communities had acted inconsistently  with its obligations under Annex C(1)(a), first clause, and Article&nbsp;8 of  the SPS Agreement because the de facto moratorium led to undue delays in the  completion of EC approval procedures.&nbsp; The panel, however, found that the  European Communities has not acted inconsistently with its obligations under  other provisions raised by the complaining parties, including Articles 5.1,  5.5, 5.6, 2.2 or 2.3 of the SPS Agreement. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> With regard to the product-specific EC measures, the panel  found that the European Communities had acted inconsistently with its  obligations under Annex C(1)(a), first clause, and Article&nbsp;8 of the SPS  Agreement in respect of the approval procedures concerning 24 out of 27 biotech  products identified by the complaining parties because there were undue delays  in the completion of the approval procedures for each of these products.&nbsp;  The panel found, however, that the European Communities had not acted  inconsistently with its obligations under any other provisions raised by the  complaining parties, including Articles 5.1, 5.5 and 2.2 of the SPS Agreement ,  with regard to any of the products concerned. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> With regard to the EC member State safeguard measures,  the panel found that the European Communities acted inconsistently with its  obligations under Articles 5.1 and 2.2 of the SPS Agreement with regard to all  of the safeguard measures at issue, because these measures were not based on  risk assessments satisfying the definition of the SPS Agreement and hence could  be presumed to be maintained without sufficient scientific evidence.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 21 November 2006, the DSB adopted the panel reports. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 19 December 2006, the European Communities announced its  intention to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in a manner  consistent with its WTO obligations. However, due to the complexity and  sensitivity of the issues involved, the European Communities would need a  reasonable period of time for implementation. Pursuant to Article&nbsp;21.3(b)  of the DSU, the European Communities was ready to discuss an appropriate  timeframe with Argentina,  Canada and the United    States. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 21 June   2007, Argentina  and the European Communities respectively notified the DSB that they had agreed  that the reasonable period of time for the European Communities to implement  the recommendations and rulings of the DSB shall be twelve months from the date  of the adoption of the panel reports. Accordingly, the reasonable period of  time expires on 21 November 2007.  On 21&nbsp;November 2007,  the parties informed the DSB that they had agreed to modify the reasonable  period of time so as to expire on 11   January 2008. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 11 January   2008, the European Communities and Argentinainformed the DSB that  they had agreed to modify the reasonable period of time so as to expire on 11 June 2008. On 11 June 2008, the European Communities and Argentina  informed the DSB that they had agreed to modify the reasonable period of time  so as to expire on 12 August 2008.  On 12&nbsp;August 2008, the  European Communities and Argentina  informed the DSB that they had agreed to modify the reasonable period of time  so as to expire on 1 December 2008.  On 1 December 2008, the  European Communities and Argentina  informed the DSB that they had agreed to modify the reasonable period of time  so as to expire on 1 March 2009.  On 26 February 2009, the European Communities and Argentina informed the DSB that they had agreed to modify  once more the reasonable period of time so as to expire on 30 June 2009.&nbsp; On 30   June 2009, the European Communities and Argentina  informed the DSB that they had agreed to modify once more the reasonable period  of time so as to expire on 31   December 2009.&nbsp; On 30 December 2009, the European Union  and Argentina  informed the DSB that they had agreed to modify once more the reasonable period  of time so as to expire on 31 January 2010.&nbsp; On 29   January 2010, the European Union and Argentina  informed the DSB that they had agreed to modify once more the reasonable period  of time so as to expire on 28 February   2010.&nbsp; On 26&nbsp;February 2010, the European  Union and Argentina  informed the DSB that they had agreed to modify once more the reasonable period  of time so as to expire on 31 March   2010.	  		</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Mutually agreed  solution</h3>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 19 March 2010, Argentina and the European Union notified the DSB of a  mutually agreed solution under Article&nbsp;3.6 of the DSU.&nbsp; The parties have agreed to establish a  bilateral dialogue on issues related to the application of biotechnology to  agriculture.</p></div>
