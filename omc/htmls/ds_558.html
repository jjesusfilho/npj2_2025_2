        <h3>Panel  and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p>On 18 October  2018, the United States requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting  on 29&nbsp;October 2018, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
        <p>At its meeting on 21 November 2018, the DSB  established a panel. Brazil, Canada, Egypt, the European Union, Guatemala,  India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, the Russian  Federation, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Chinese Taipei, Thailand,  Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela reserved their third-party rights.</p>
        <p>On 7 January 2019, the United States  requested the Director-General to compose the panel. On 25&nbsp;January&nbsp;2019,  the Director-General composed the panel.</p>
        <p align="left">On 4 September 2019, the Chair of the  panel informed the DSB that the panel expected to issue its final report to the  parties by the second half of 2020. The Chair also  informed the DSB that the report would be available to the public once it was  circulated to the Members in all three official languages, and that the date of  circulation depends on completion of translation. On 15 December 2020, the Chair of the  panel informed the DSB that due to the delays caused by the global COVID-19  pandemic, the panel now expected to issue its final report to the parties by  the second half of 2021. On 9 December  2021, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that due to the complexity of the  dispute and the delays caused by  the global COVID-19 pandemic, the panel  expected to issue its final report to the parties no earlier than the first  half of 2022. On 23 January 2023,  the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that progress had been made in these  proceedings over the course of 2022 and that the panel expected to issue its  final report to the parties by mid-2023.</p>

    	    <p>This dispute concerns additional duties imposed by China on  certain products originating in the United States. The Panel referred to the  measure through which these duties were imposed as the &ldquo;additional duties  measure&rdquo;. The United States challenged the additional duties measure as  inconsistent with Articles I:1, II:1(a), and II:1(b) of the GATT 1994. </p>
            <p><strong>Compliance of the United States' panel request with  Article 6.2 of the DSU</strong></p>
            <p>The Panel began by addressing  China's objection that, by only claiming inconsistency with Articles I and II  of the GATT 1994 in its panel request and failing to raise a claim under  Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Safeguards, which, in China's  view, were the provisions pursuant to which the measure at issue was adopted,  the United States had not provided a brief summary of the legal basis of its  complaint sufficient to present the problem clearly. The Panel noted that  Article&nbsp;6.2 of the DSU entrusts each complainant with the discretion to  decide which of the covered agreements to bring claims under, and does not  additionally require that the &ldquo;brief summary of the legal basis&rdquo; of  the complaint presented in the panel request be full or correct. It further  explained that while a failure to identify the full or correct legal basis of  the claim in the panel request may have consequences at the merits stage of the  proceedings, it does not, in itself, render the panel request defective in  terms of Article 6.2 of the DSU. Accordingly, the Panel rejected China's  objection.</p>
            <p><strong>Applicability of the relevant covered agreements </strong></p>
            <p>The Panel then turned to China's argument that the additional  duties measure was subject to Article 8.2 of the Agreement on Safeguards and  Article XIX:3(a) of the GATT 1994, and that the application of Articles I and  II of the GATT 1994 to that measure was therefore suspended. The Panel  considered that whether Article 8.2 of the Agreement on Safeguards and Article  XIX:3(a) of the GATT 1994 apply to China's additional duties measure depended  on the characterization under the Agreement on Safeguards of the underlying  measure adopted by the United States, in response to which China had adopted  the additional duties measure.</p>
            <p>With respect to the relevant measures of the United States, the  Panel concluded that those measures were sought, taken, or maintained pursuant  to a provision of the GATT 1994 other than Article XIX, namely Article XXI of  the GATT 1994. The Panel accordingly found that the Agreement on Safeguards did  not apply to those measures, as provided in Article 11.1(c) of that Agreement. Consequently,  the Panel also found that Article 8.2 of the Agreement on Safeguards and  Article XIX:3(a) of the GATT 1994 did not apply to China's additional duties  measure, as the rights under those two provisions are unavailable in respect of  measures to which the Agreement on Safeguards does not apply.</p>
            <p><strong>Claims under the GATT 1994</strong></p>
            <p>The Panel found that China's additional duties measure was  inconsistent with Article I:1 of the GATT 1994 because, with respect to customs  duties imposed on or in connection with importation, China failed to accord the  advantage of lower tariff rates granted to products imported from other  countries immediately and unconditionally to products originating in the United  States. The Panel also found that the additional duties measure was  inconsistent with Articles&nbsp;II:1(a) and II:1(b) of the GATT 1994 because it  resulted in the imposition of ordinary customs duties in excess of those  provided in China's Schedule and accorded to imports from the United States  treatment less favourable than that provided for in China's Schedule.<strong></strong></p>

          </div>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>

        <p>On 18 September 2023, China notified the DSB of its  decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law and legal  interpretations in the panel report. China indicated that given that no  division of the Appellate Body could be established to hear this appeal, and in  the interests of fairness and the orderly procedure in the conduct of the  appeal, China would await instructions regarding any further steps to be taken  in this appeal. </p>
