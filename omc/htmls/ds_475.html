        <h3> Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">On 27 June 2014, the European Union requested the  establishment of a panel. At  its meeting on 10&nbsp;July 2014, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>        <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 22  July 2014, the DSB established a panel. Australia, China, India, Japan,  Korea, Norway, Chinese Taipei and the United States  reserved their third-party rights. Subsequently,  Brazil and South Africa reserved their third-party rights. On 13 October 2014, the European  Union requested the  Director-General to compose the panel. On 23 October 2014, the Director-General  composed the panel.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">Following the resignation of a member of the panel  on 30 October 2014, and pursuant to a request from the European  Union on 3 November 2014, the  Director-General appointed a new member of the panel on 6 November 2014.  Following the resignation of a member of the panel on 26&nbsp;November&nbsp;2014,  and pursuant to a request from the European Union on 28&nbsp;November  2014, the Director-General appointed a new member of the panel on 4 December  2014.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 22 April 2015, the Chair of the panel informed the  DSB that the panel expected to issue its final report to the parties by  February 2016, in accordance with the timetable adopted after  consultation with the parties. On 7 January 2016, the Chair of the panel informed  the DSB that in light of modifications to the timetable, as well as of the  scale and complexity of the dispute, the panel expected to  issue its final report to the parties by early April 2016.</p>

        <p class="paranormaltext">This dispute concerns SPS measures  imposed by Russia between January and September 2014 on imports of pigs, pork  and other pig products from the European Union relating to outbreaks of African  swine fever (ASF) in the European&nbsp;Union. Russia imposed an EU-wide import  ban, as well as individual import bans in respect of products originating in  four EU member States: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (EU member State  bans).</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The European Union challenged the  EU-wide ban and the EU member State bans, as being inconsistent with provisions  of the SPS Agreement relative to: harmonization (Articles 3.1, 3.2, and&nbsp;3.3),  adaptation to regional conditions (Articles 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3), SPS approval  procedures (Article 8 and Annex C), the scientific basis of the measures  (Articles 5.1, 5.2, 5.7 and 2.2), the application of SPS measures (Articles  5.3, 5.4, and 5.6), discrimination (Articles 2.3 and 5.5), and transparency  (Articles 7 and Annex B). </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">Russia argued that the EU member State  bans conform to the relevant international standards (pursuant to Article 3.2),  and are therefore presumed to be consistent with the relevant provisions of the  SPS Agreement. In the alternative, Russia argued that it had objectively  rejected the European Union's suggested disease free areas, and therefore the  EU member State bans are not inconsistent with Russia's obligations under the  SPS Agreement. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">Russia argued that the EU-wide ban is  not an SPS measure. Russia argued that, in the alternative, if the Panel were  to consider it to be so, it conforms to the extent possible to the relevant  international standards (pursuant to Article 3.1), and Russia was justified in  adopting the EU-wide ban as a provisional measure (pursuant to Article 5.7). On  these grounds, Russia argued that the EU-wide ban is not inconsistent with  Russia's obligations under the SPS Agreement. Russia also argued that it did  not apply its SPS measures in a discriminatory manner.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The Panel found that claims in respect  of the EU-wide and the EU member State bans were within its terms of reference.  The Panel also found that the EU-wide ban and each of the EU member State bans  are SPS measures within the meaning of Annex&nbsp;A(1) of the SPS Agreement.</p>
    	<p class="paranormaltext">Regarding  the claims on harmonization, the Panel found that the bans on imports of the  products at issue from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland do not  &ldquo;conform to&rdquo; the relevant OIE international standards and thus are  inconsistent with Article 3.2 of the SPS Agreement. The Panel also found that the EU-wide ban, as well as the bans on imports of  products treated to ensure destruction of ASF (treated products) from Estonia,  Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland and on imports of products not treated to ensure  destruction of ASF (non-treated products) from Estonia, Lithuania, and Poland  are not &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the OIE standards and are thus inconsistent with  Russia's obligation to &ldquo;base&rdquo; its SPS measures on international  standards, pursuant to Article 3.1 of the SPS Agreement. Moreover, the Panel  found that the ban on non-treated products from Latvia is &ldquo;based on&rdquo;  the relevant international standards and is thus consistent with Article 3.1 of  the SPS Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">In respect of adaptation to regional  conditions, the Panel found that Russia recognizes the concepts of pest- or  disease-free areas and areas of low pest or disease prevalence in respect of  ASF, and therefore, the EU-wide ban and the EU member State bans are not  inconsistent with Russia's obligations under Article 6.2 of the  SPS&nbsp;Agreement. The Panel also found that as at 11 September 2014, the  European Union provided to Russia the necessary evidence to objectively  demonstrate, pursuant to Article 6.3 of the SPS Agreement, that there are:  (i)&nbsp;areas within the EU territory outside Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and  Poland, which are free of ASF and are likely to remain so; as well as (ii) areas  within Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland that are free of ASF and are  likely to remain so. However, the EU failed to provide to Russia the necessary  evidence to objectively demonstrate that there are areas within Latvia that are  likely to remain ASF-free. The Panel also found that Russia did not adapt the  EU-wide ban and the bans on products from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and  Poland to the SPS characteristics of the areas from where the products  originated nor to the ASF-related characteristics in Russia. Nor did Russia  perform a risk assessment on which it could base its evaluation of the relevant  elements to determine the SPS characteristics of the areas from which the  products at issue originate. Therefore, the EU-wide ban and the bans on the imports  of the products at issue from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland are  inconsistent with Article 6.1 of the SPS Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">Regarding Russia's SPS approval  procedures, the Panel found that Russia's process of consideration of the  request for recognition of ASF-free areas within the EU, including the four  affected member States, falls within the scope of Article 8 and Annex C(1) of  the SPS Agreement; and Russia required information that was not limited to what  is necessary for the procedure at issue, thus breaching Annex C(1)(c), and  completed the procedure with undue delay, thus breaching Annex&nbsp;C(1)(a),  with the result that the procedure is also inconsistent with Article 8 of the  SPS Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">In respect of the scientific basis of  the measures, the Panel found that the EU-wide ban and  the EU member State bans do not fulfill the conditions to qualify as  provisional measures pursuant to Article&nbsp;5.7. The qualified exemption from  the obligations in Articles 5.1, 5.2 and 2.2 of the SPS Agreement is thus not  available to Russia. The Panel also found that Russia did not base the measures  at issue on a risk assessment within the meaning of the SPS Agreement, thus  breaching Articles  5.1 and 5.2. Moreover, the Panel found that as Russia has failed to rebut the presumption  of inconsistency of the measures with Article&nbsp;2.2 raised by the finding of  violation of Articles 5.1 and 5.2, the measures are thus inconsistent with  Article 2.2 of the SPS Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">Regarding the application of the SPS  measures, the Panel found that the EU-wide ban and the EU member State bans are  inconsistent with Article 5.3 of the SPS&nbsp;Agreement because, by not basing  the measures on a risk assessment, Russia could not have taken into account the  relevant economic factors listed in Article 5.3 when assessing the risks of  entry and spread of ASF. The Panel also found that the EU-wide ban and the EU  member State bans are inconsistent with Article&nbsp;5.6 of the SPS Agreement  because they are significantly more trade restrictive than required to achieve  Russia's appropriate level of protection (ALOP). In light of this and the lack  of rebuttal by Russia of the presumption of inconsistency with Article 2.2  arising from a finding of inconsistency with Article 5.6, the Panel found the  measures to be inconsistent with Article 2.2 of the SPS Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">In respect of claims pertaining to  discrimination, the Panel found that Russia's measures are inconsistent with  Article&nbsp;2.3, first sentence, of the SPS&nbsp;Agreement because they  arbitrarily and unjustifiably discriminate between Members where identical or  similar conditions prevail. The Panel also found that Russia's measures are  inconsistent with Article&nbsp;2.3, second sentence, because they are applied  in a manner which constitutes a disguised restriction on international trade. The  Panel exercised judicial economy with respect to the European Union's claims  under Article 5.5. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The Panel declined to rule on claims  on transparency due to the EU's failure to establish a <em>prima facie</em> case. </p>

</div>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 23 September 2016, the Russian Federation notified  the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law  and legal interpretations in the panel report. On 28 September 2016, the European  Union notified the DSB of its decision to cross-appeal.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 21 November  2016, upon expiry of the 60-day period provided for in Article 17.5 of the DSU,  the Appellate Body informed the DSB that the circulation date of the Appellate  Body report in this appeal will be communicated to the participants and third  participants shortly after the oral hearing, in the light of scheduling of  parallel appeals, and shortage of staff in the Appellate Body Secretariat. On 16 December 2016, the Appellate Body informed the DSB that it expected to circulate the Appellate Body report in this appeal no later than 23 February 2017.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
<p>Following outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) in certain regions of the European Union in 2014, Russia imposed restrictions on the importation of live pigs, pork, and certain pig products from the European Union. In particular, Russia adopted country-specific bans on imports of the products at issue from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, which suffered ASF outbreaks, as well as a ban on imports of these products from all EU member States (the &ldquo;EU-wide ban&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Russia appealed the Panel findings that the EU-wide ban is a measure attributable to Russia, and that there was no limitation, in Russia's terms of accession to the WTO, on the Panel's assessment of the European Union's claims in respect of the ban. Russia further challenged certain Panel findings under Articles 6.3 and 6.1 of the SPS Agreement. First, it claimed that the Panel erred in finding European Union had provided the necessary evidence to objectively demonstrate to Russia that certain areas within the European Union's territory were, and were likely to remain, ASF-free. Second, Russia alleged that the Panel erred in finding that Russia had failed to adapt the ban on imports from Latvia to the ASF situation of areas within the Latvian territory. The European Union, for its part, appealed the Panel's finding that Russia recognizes the concepts of pest- or disease free areas and areas of low pest or disease prevalence in respect of ASF, and that the measures at issue are, therefore, n not inconsistent with Article 6.2 of the SPS Agreement.  </p>
<p><strong>The attribution of the EU-wide ban to Russia  </strong></p>
<p>Concerning Russia's claims as to the attribution of the EU-wide ban, the Appellate Body considered that the measure at issue consisted of Russia's decision to deny the importation of the products at issue from the whole European Union. The Appellate Body noted that the basis for the EU-wide ban stemmed from the requirement, set out in the bilateral veterinary certificates agreed with the European Union, that the entire European Union be free from ASF for a period of at least three years. However, according to the Appellate Body, the fact that the basis for the ban may not have been set out in Russian law does not alter the conclusion that the action of restricting imports of the products at issue is attributable to Russia. The Appellate Body further considered that the Panel was not barred from reviewing the WTO consistency of the EU-wide ban due to commitments set out in Russia's terms of accession to the WTO. Irrespective of the commitment in Russia's terms of accession regarding which veterinary certificate would be operative in the conduct of certain trade to Russia from other WTO Members, Russia remains under an ongoing obligation, pursuant to Article 6 of the SPS Agreement, to adapt its measures to regional SPS characteristics. Therefore, the Appellate Body upheld the Panel's findings that the EU-wide ban is a measure attributable to Russia, and that there was no limitation, in Russia's terms of accession to the WTO, on the Panel's assessment of the European Union's claims in respect of the ban.  </p>
<p><strong>Article 6.3 of the SPS Agreement  </strong></p>
<p>The first sentence of Article 6.3 of the SPS Agreement stipulates that an exporting Member claiming that areas within its territory are pest- or disease-free or of low pest or disease prevalence shall provide the necessary evidence to objectively demonstrate to the importing Member that such areas are and are likely to remain so. The Appellate Body rejected Russia's contentions that Article 6.3 requires consideration of the evidence relied upon by the importing Member and contemplates a certain period of time for the importing Member to evaluate and verify the evidence provided by the exporting Member. The Appellate Body explained that the regionalization process set out in Article 6 of the SPS Agreement does require an importing Member to evaluate all the relevant evidence concerning the areas that an exporting Member claims are pest- or disease free or of low pest or disease prevalence. Articles 6.1 and 6.2 relate to this evaluation, as well as to the period of time that the importing Member may take to conduct it. Article 6.3, however, does not stipulate disciplines of the importing Member with regard to the evaluation of evidence, but rather addresses the duties applying to the exporting Member. Hence, the Appellate Body upheld the Panel's finding that the European Union had provided the necessary evidence to objectively demonstrate to Russia, pursuant to Article 6.3, that certain areas within the European Union's territory were, and were likely to remain, ASF-free.  </p>
<p><strong>The relationship between Articles 6.1 and 6.3 of the SPS Agreement  </strong></p>
<p>Article 6.1 of the SPS Agreement requires Members to ensure the adaptation of their measures to the SPS characteristics of the area from which a product originates and of the area to which the product is destined. The Appellate Body considered that an exporting Member's failure to provide the evidence necessary to objectively demonstrate, pursuant to Article 6.3 of the SPS Agreement, that areas within its territory are pest- or disease-free or of low pest or disease prevalence will, in many cases, have implications for the importing Member's ability to assess the SPS characteristics of such areas and to adapt its measures accordingly, as required by Article 6.1. A panel may, in certain specific situations, find that an importing Member failed to comply with Article 6.1 irrespective of the exporting Member's non-compliance with Article 6.3. However, the panel should provide reasoning explaining why the circumstances of the dispute warrant a finding that the importing Member acted inconsistently with Article 6.1. As the Panel did not provide such reasoning, the Appellate Body modified the Panel's finding that Russia did not adapt the ban on imports from Latvia to the SPS characteristics of areas within the Latvian territory. However, the Appellate Body also noted the Panel's unappealed finding that Russia had failed to adapt its measure to the SPS characteristics of areas within the Russian territory to which the products at issue are destined, and considered that finding to constitute a sufficient ground to affirm the Panel's conclusion that the ban on imports of the products at issue from Latvia is inconsistent with Article 6.1 of the SPS Agreement.  </p>
<p><strong>Article 6.2 of the SPS Agreement  </strong></p>
<p>Article 6.2 of the SPS Agreement requires that Members recognize the concepts of pest- or disease-free areas and areas of low pest or disease prevalence. The Appellate Body disagreed with the Panel's finding that Article 6.2 requires merely an acknowledgement of such concepts in the form of abstract ideas, and considered that the Panel erred in deeming itself precluded from taking into account in its analysis under Article 6.2 specific instances of recognition or non recognition of the concept of regionalization. Instead, the Appellate Body considered that Article 6.2 requires the importing Member to provide an effective opportunity for the exporting Member to make the claim, addressed to the importing Member, that areas within its territory are pest- or disease free or of low pest or disease prevalence and thus render operational the concepts of pest- or disease-free areas and areas of low pest or disease prevalence. This may be achieved through, individually or jointly: a provision in the regulatory framework; the very SPS measure at issue; and a practice of recognizing pest- or disease-free areas or areas of low pest or disease prevalence. All these elements may be relevant to assessing a Member's compliance with Article 6.2, depending on the circumstances of the case and the particular instruments at issue. On this basis, the Appellate Body reversed the Panel's finding that Russia recognizes the concepts of pest- or disease free areas and areas of low pest or disease prevalence in respect of ASF, and that therefore the measures at issue are not inconsistent with Article 6.2 of the SPS Agreement.</p>

<p>At its meeting on 21 March 2017, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
<p>
  At the DSB meeting on 19 April 2017, the Russian  Federation stated that it intended to implement the DSB's recommendations and  rulings in a manner that respects its WTO obligations and that it would need a  reasonable period of time to do so. </p>
<p>On 19 May 2017, the European Union and the Russian  Federation informed the DSB that in order to allow sufficient time for them to  discuss a mutually agreed period under Article 21.3(b) or for an arbitration  under Article 21.3(c) of the DSU to be completed, they agreed to be flexible on  the applicable deadlines.</p>
<p>On 2 June 2017, the European Union and the Russian  Federation informed the DSB that they had agreed that the reasonable period of  time to implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings would be 8 months and  15 days. Accordingly, the reasonable period of time was set to expire on 6&nbsp;December&nbsp;2017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
<p>
  On 8 December 2017, the Russian  Federation informed the DSB that it had taken the appropriate steps to comply  with the DSB's recommendations and rulings within the reasonable period of  time. The Russian Federation explained that it had done so through Directive No. FS-NV-7/26504 issued by the Federal Service for  Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (&ldquo;Rosselkhoznadzor&rdquo;) on 5&nbsp;December  2017. The Russian Federation further informed the DSB that it had provided the  Directive to the European Union and notified it to WTO Members through the WTO  SPS Notification Submission System (see G/SPS/N/RUS/146). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Proceedings under Article 22 of the DSU  (remedies)</h3>
<p>
  On 19 December 2017, the European Union  requested the authorization of the DSB to suspend concessions or other  obligations pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU on the grounds that the Russian  Federation had failed to comply with the DSB's recommendations and rulings  within the reasonable period of time. The European Union  indicated that it had failed to conclude a sequencing agreement with the  Russian Federation. </p>
<p> On 20 December 2017, the Russian  Federation informed the DSB that it disagreed with the European Union's view that  the Russian Federation had failed to comply with the DSB's recommendations and  rulings within the reasonable period of time. The Russian  Federation objected to the European Union's proposed level of suspension of  concessions pursuant to Article 22.6 of the DSU. </p>
<p>At the DSB meeting on 3 January 2018, the  Chair of the DSB took note that the matter raised by the Russian  Federation had been  referred  to arbitration pursuant to Article 22.6 of the DSU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Compliance  proceedings (recourse by the Russian Federation)</h3>
<p> On 25 January 2018, the Russian Federation requested  consultations with the European Union pursuant to Article 21.5 of the DSU with  respect to certain measures taken by the Russian Federation to comply with the  DSB's recommendations and rulings in this dispute. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3> Compliance  proceedings (recourse by the European Union)</h3>
<p> On 2 February  2018, the European Union requested consultations with the Russian Federation pursuant  to Article 21.5 of the DSU with respect to certain measures adopted by the  Russian Federation concerning the importation of the products at issue from the  European Union and a disagreement as to the existence or consistency with the  covered agreements of measures taken to comply by the Russian Federation with  the DSB's recommendations and rulings in this dispute.</p>
<p>On 18 October 2018, the European Union requested  the establishment of a compliance panel. At its meeting on 29 October 2018, the  DSB deferred the establishment of a compliance panel. At  its meeting on 21 November 2018, the DSB agreed to refer to the original panel,  if possible, the matter raised by the European Union. Australia,  Brazil, Canada, China, India,  Japan, Kazakhstan, Chinese Taipei, Ukraine, and the United States reserved  their third-party rights.</p>
<p>The compliance panel was composed by the  original panelists. On 25 March 2019, the Chair of the compliance panel  informed the DSB that the panel expected to issue its final report, based on  the timetable adopted after consultation with the parties, in the first quarter  of 2020.</p>
<p>On 28 January 2020, the Chair of the  panel informed the DSB that it had granted the European Union&rsquo;s request of 24  January 2020, to suspend its work pursuant to Article 12.12 of the DSU. The panel noted that its authority would lapse on 28 January  2021 unless the European Union indicated that it wished the panel to recommence  its work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Withdrawal/termination</h3>
<p>
  As the compliance  panel had not been requested to resume its work, pursuant to Article 12.12 of  the DSU, the authority for establishment of the panel lapsed as of 28  January 2021.</p>
