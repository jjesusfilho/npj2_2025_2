            <p>This  dispute between Japan and India concerned a safeguard measure imposed by India on  imports of certain steel products. Japan claimed that the measure at issue was  inconsistent with various provisions of the Agreement on Safeguards and the  GATT 1994. </p>
            <p>Japan  challenged different aspects of the Indian competent authority's determination relating  to: unforeseen developments and the effect of GATT obligations; increased imports;  the definition of domestic industry; serious injury or threat thereof; causal  link between increased imports and serious injury caused to the domestic  industry; other factors causing injury to the domestic industry simultaneously  with increased imports; the level of duties imposed; and the duration of the  safeguard measure. Japan also made procedural claims regarding the obligation  to notify the WTO Committee on Safeguards and to provide an adequate opportunity  for prior consultations. In addition, Japan claimed that the measure at issue  was inconsistent with Article I of the GATT&nbsp;1994 and Article II:1(b),  second sentence, of the GATT 1994. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>As  a preliminary matter, the Panel addressed India's request that since the  measure at issue had expired, Japan's complaint was incompatible with Article  3.7 of the DSU. The Panel found that in the circumstances of the present case,  the expiry of the measure after the establishment of the Panel did not excuse the  Panel from exercising its function under Article 11 of the DSU to make findings  with respect to the matter raised by Japan, as well as to make recommendations  to the extent that the measure continued to have any effects.</p>
            <p>Before  addressing Japan's substantive and procedural claims, the Panel considered  whether the measure at issue constituted a safeguard measure within the meaning  of Article XIX of the GATT&nbsp;1994 and the Agreement on Safeguards. The Panel  considered that the measure resulted in a suspension of India's obligations  under the GATT&nbsp;1994, namely Article II:1(b), second sentence, and was  designed to remedy an alleged situation of serious injury to the domestic  industry brought about by an increase in imports of certain steel products. The  Panel thus concluded that the measure at issue constituted a safeguard measure  and that the provisions of Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and the Agreement on  Safeguards were applicable to the dispute. </p>
            <p>With  respect to Japan's substantive claims, the Panel's main findings were:</p>
    <ul> 
		<li>India  acted inconsistently with Article XIX:1(a) of the GATT 1994, by failing to  demonstrate that the unforeseen developments and the effect of GATT obligations  resulted in an increase in imports of the product concerned causing or  threatening to cause serious injury to the relevant domestic industry in India.</li>
        
              <li>India acted inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;2.1 and  4.2(a) of the Agreement on Safeguards and Article&nbsp;XIX:1 of the GATT 1994, by  failing to evaluate the rate and amount of the increase in imports on the basis  of objective data, when it analysed the increase in imports at least partly on  annualized data, and by failing to objectively examine the trends in imports. </li>
              <li>Japan  did not demonstrate that India failed to meet the requirement of &ldquo;a major  proportion&rdquo; of the total domestic production of the product concerned under  Article 4.1(c) of the Agreement on Safeguards, when it defined the domestic  industry.</li>
              <li>India  acted inconsistently with Articles 4.1(a) and 4.2(a) of the Agreement on  Safeguards, by failing to properly evaluate and sufficiently explain the  changes in import prices and their effect on the domestic industry's prices and  therefore on profitability. The Panel, however, rejected Japan's arguments that  the Indian competent authority failed to assess the captive segment of the  market, when it evaluated the share of the domestic market taken by increased  imports. The Panel also rejected Japan's argument that India failed to provide  any explanation regarding the positive trends in certain injury factors.</li>
              <li>India  acted inconsistently with Articles 4.1(b) and 4.2(a) of the Agreement on  Safeguards, because its finding of a threat of serious injury was not  adequately addressed or analysed in the Final Findings.</li>
              <li>India  acted inconsistently with Article 4.2(b) of the Agreement on Safeguards, by  failing to demonstrate the existence of a causal link between the increased  imports and serious injury suffered by the domestic industry, and by failing to  conduct a proper non-attribution analysis.</li>
              <li>India  acted inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 4.2(c) of the Agreement on  Safeguards, by failing to provide reasoned conclusions on all pertinent issues  of fact and law.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p>With  regard to procedural claims, the Panel's main findings were:</p>
			  <ul>
              <li>Japan  did not demonstrate that India acted inconsistently with Articles 12.1(a), (b)  and (c) and 12.2 of the Agreement on Safeguards, with respect to the  notifications to the Committee on Safeguards of the initiation of a safeguard  investigation relating to serious injury or threat thereof, the findings of  serious injury in the investigation, and the decision to apply a definitive  safeguard measure.</li>
              <li>India  acted inconsistently with Article 12.2 of the Agreement on Safeguards, by  failing to provide the Committee on Safeguards with a precise description of  the product involved and a precise description of the proposed measure.</li>
              <li>India  acted inconsistently with Article 12.3 of the Agreement on Safeguards, by  failing to provide Japan, and other Members with a substantial export interest  in the product subject to the proposed safeguard measure, with an adequate  opportunity for prior consultations with a view to reviewing all pertinent  information.</li>
              <li>India  acted inconsistently with Article 12.4 of the Agreement on Safeguards, by  failing to notify the Committee on Safeguards before taking the provisional  safeguard measure at issue.</li>
</ul>    
			  <p>The  Panel exercised judicial economy on several claims, including Japan's claim on  Articles 5.1 and 7.1 of the Agreement on Safeguards with respect to the  duration of the safeguard measure and the level of the duties imposed.</p>

    	<p class="paranormaltext">On 14 December 2018, India notified the DSB of  its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law and legal  interpretations in the panel report. On 21 December 2018, Japan notified the DSB of its  decision to cross-appeal.</p>
    	<p class="paranormaltext">On 12 February 2019, upon expiry of the 60-day period  provided for in Article 17.5 of the DSU, the Appellate Body informed the DSB  that it would not be able to circulate the Appellate Body report in this appeal  by the end of the 60-day period, nor within the 90-day time-frame provided for  in Article 17.5 of the DSU. The Appellate Body referred to the size of the  panel record and the complexity of issued that had been appealed. The Appellate  Body also noted the backlog of appeals pending with the Appellate Body at present,  and the fact that all appeals filed since 1 October 2018 were composed of the  same three remaining Appellate Body Members. The Appellate  Body indicated that, as communicated to the participants, it would not be  possible to staff this appeal for some time, and expressed appreciation for the  participants' understanding. The Appellate Body informed the DSB that the  Appellate Body would communicate appropriately with participants as soon as it  knew more precisely when the Division can schedule the hearing in this appeal.</p>
