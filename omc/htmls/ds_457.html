        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Guatemala. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 12 April 2013, Guatemala requested consultations  with Peru with respect to the imposition by Peru of an &ldquo;additional  duty&rdquo; on imports of certain agricultural products, such as rice, sugar,  maize, milk and certain dairy products.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Guatemala claims that the measure at issue is  inconsistent with:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">Article 4.2 and footnote 1 of the Agreement on  Agriculture;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">Articles II:1(a), II:1(b), X:1, X:3(a), XI and XI:1 of the GATT  1994; and<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 of the Customs  Valuation Agreement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 13 June 2013, Guatemala requested the  establishment of a panel.&nbsp; At its meeting  on 25 June 2013, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 23 July 2013, the DSB established a panel.  Argentina, China, El&nbsp;Salvador, the European&nbsp;Union, India and the  United States reserved their third party rights.&nbsp; Subsequently, Brazil, Ecuador, Honduras  and Korea reserved  their third party rights. Following the agreement of the parties, the panel  was composed on 19 September 2013.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 17 March 2014, the Chair of the panel informed  the DSB that the panel expects to issue its final report to the parties by  September 2014, in accordance with the timetable adopted after consultation  with the parties. On 25 September 2014, the Chair of the panel  informed the DSB that in light of modifications to the timetable that were  requested by the parties, the panel expects to  issue its final report to the parties  in October 2014.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="bkmk457r" name="bkmk457r"></a>On 27 November 2014, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p class="paranormaltext">This dispute concerns the additional duties imposed by Peru on  imports of certain agricultural products (dairy products, corn, rice and sugar).  These duties are determined using a mechanism known as the Price Range System  (PRS), which operates on the basis of: (i) a range constituted by a floor price  and a ceiling price, which reflect international prices over the last 60  months; and (ii) a reference price published every two weeks, reflecting the  average international market price for each product concerned. An additional  duty is applied if the reference price of the affected product is lower than  the floor price. Conversely, if the reference price exceeds the ceiling price,  the applicable tariff is reduced.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">Guatemala argued that  Peru's additional duties are: (i) variable import levies, minimum import  prices, or at least border measures similar to variable import levies or  minimum import prices, and thus, should have been converted into ordinary  customs duties under Article 4.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture; and (ii)  &ldquo;other duties or charges&rdquo; different from ordinary customs duties, which  had not been registered in Peru's Schedule of Concessions, and are therefore in  breach of Article&nbsp;II:1(b) of the GATT 1994. Guatemala raised additional  claims under Articles X:1 and X:3(a) of the GATT 1994, regarding the  publication and administration of the measure. Guatemala also raised  alternative claims under Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 of the Customs Valuation Agreement.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">Peru argued that the  additional duties form part of its tariff and are, therefore, ordinary customs  duties. Peru also argued that, under the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed  between Guatemala and Peru in December 2011, Peru was allowed to maintain its  PRS. Consequently, the good faith requirement contained in Articles&nbsp;3.7  and 3.10 of the DSU prevents Guatemala from challenging the PRS in WTO dispute  settlement proceedings. Moreover, Peru argued that, by means of the FTA, the  parties had modified their reciprocal WTO rights and obligations; accordingly, the  FTA, which allows the use of the PRS, should prevail. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The Panel found no  evidence that Guatemala brought these proceedings in a manner contrary to its good  faith obligations under Articles 3.7 and 3.10 of the DSU. Therefore, the Panel  found no reason to refrain from assessing Guatemala's claims.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The Panel also found  that, because the FTA has not entered into force, its provisions were not at  the time of the panel report binding on the parties. Accordingly, it was not necessary  for the Panel to express any opinion on whether the parties may, by means of an  FTA, modify between themselves their rights and obligations under the WTO  covered agreements.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The Panel found that  Peru acted inconsistently with its obligation under Article 4.2 of the  Agreement of Agriculture by maintaining measures of the kind that were required  to be converted into ordinary customs duties. In particular, the Panel found  that the additional duties resulting from the PRS constitute variable import  levies or, at least, share sufficient characteristics with variable import  levies to be considered border measures similar to variable import levies,  within the meaning of footnote 1 to the Agreement on Agriculture. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The Panel also found that the additional duties resulting from the PRS  do not constitute minimum import prices, and do not share sufficient  characteristics with minimum import prices in order to be considered border  measures similar to minimum import prices, within the meaning of footnote 1 to  the Agreement on Agriculture.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The Panel found that the  additional duties resulting from the PRS cannot be considered ordinary customs  duties. In the Panel's view,  those duties are &ldquo;other duties or charges imposed on, or in connection  with, importation&rdquo;, within the meaning of the second sentence of Article  II:1(b) of the GATT 1994. Peru had not registered any such &ldquo;other duties  or charges&rdquo; in its Schedule of Concessions. Therefore, by imposing these duties,  Peru is acting inconsistently with its obligations under the second sentence of  Article II:1(b) of the GATT&nbsp;1994.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">Having decided that  the additional duties resulting from the PRS are inconsistent with Article 4.2  of the Agreement on Agriculture and Article II:1(b) of the GATT 1994, the Panel considered it unnecessary  to make additional findings under Articles X:1 or X:3(a) of the GATT 1994.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">Given that the Panel  found that the additional duties resulting from the PRS were not ordinary customs  duties, the Panel did not  address Guatemala's alternative claims under the Customs Valuation Agreement.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">Bearing in mind that Guatemala  contested the additional duties resulting from the PRS but not the PRS itself,  the Panel did not consider it appropriate to use its discretion under the  second sentence of Article 19.1 of the DSU to suggest that the mechanism  underlying the calculation of the additional duties be eliminated. Instead, the  Panel recommended that Peru be requested to bring its measure into conformity with  its WTO obligations. </p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 3 December  2014, Peru and Guatemala requested the DSB to  adopt a draft decision extending the 60-day time period stipulated in Article  16.4 of the DSU, no earlier than 9 February 2015 and  no later than 25 March 2015. At its meeting on 17 December  2014, the DSB agreed that, it  shall no later than 25 March 2015, adopt the panel report unless (i)  the DSB decides by consensus not to do so or (ii) Guatemala or Peru notifies  the DSB of its decision to appeal the panel report.</p>

<p class="paranormaltext">On 25 March 2015, Peru notified the DSB of its  decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law and legal  interpretation in the panel report. On 30 March  2015, Guatemala notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate  Body certain issues of law and legal interpretation in the panel report.</p>

      <p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="bkmk457abr" name="bkmk457abr"></a>On 20&nbsp;July&nbsp;2015, the Appellate Body issued  its Report in DS457. The appeal was completed in 117 days.</p>

           <ul class="paranormaltext">   <li>The  Appellate Body <strong>found</strong> that Peru's arguments on appeal pertain to issues of law covered in the Panel  Report and legal interpretations developed by the Panel, and thus do not constitute a &ldquo;new defence&rdquo;. <br />
&nbsp;           </li>
              <li>As there was no clear stipulation in the FTA of a  relinquishment by Guatemala of its right to have recourse to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, the Appellate Body <strong>found</strong> that Guatemala could not be considered to have acted contrary to its good faith  obligations under Articles 3.7 and 3.10. </li></ul>
              <p  class="paranormaltext"><b>Article&nbsp;4.2 of the Agreement on  Agriculture &mdash; &ldquo;variable import levies&rdquo;</b></p>
             <ul  class="paranormaltext"> <li>The  Appellate Body ruled that a &ldquo;variable import levy&rdquo; is &ldquo;inherently&rdquo;  variable because it incorporates a scheme or formula that causes and ensures  that levies change automatically and continuously. The Appellate Body dismissed  Peru's arguments and <strong>found</strong> that Peru had not established that the Panel  erred in its assessment of &ldquo;inherent variability&rdquo;.<br />
&nbsp;             </li>
              <li>The  Appellate Body <strong>rejected</strong> Peru's challenge regarding the Panel's  assessment of the &ldquo;additional features&rdquo; of &ldquo;variable import  levies&rdquo;, finding that the Panel had not erred in its analysis. <br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>The  Appellate Body <strong>rejected</strong> Peru's challenge under Article&nbsp;11 of the  DSU because it related to the legal standard applied by the Panel under  Article&nbsp;4.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, and not the Panel's objective  assessment of the evidence before it. </li></ul>
              <p  class="paranormaltext"><b>Article&nbsp;II:1(b) of the GATT&nbsp;1994</b></p>
              <ul  class="paranormaltext">
                <li>The  Appellate Body <strong>found</strong> that the Panel was correct in taking into account its  finding under Article&nbsp;4.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture when reaching  the finding that the additional duties are not &ldquo;ordinary customs  duties&rdquo; under Article&nbsp;II:1(b) of the GATT&nbsp;1994.<br />
&nbsp;                </li>
              <li>The  Appellate Body <strong>rejected</strong> Peru's challenge under Article&nbsp;11 of the  DSU because it related to the legal standard applied by the Panel under  Article&nbsp;II:1(b) of the GATT&nbsp;1994, and not the Panel's objective  assessment of the evidence before it. </li></ul>
              <p  class="paranormaltext"><b>Relationship between WTO and FTA provisions</b></p>
           <ul  class="paranormaltext">   <li>The  Appellate Body <strong>found</strong> that Peru's arguments regarding the interpretation  of certain WTO provisions in accordance with Article&nbsp;31(3) of the Vienna  Convention concerned issues of law covered in the Panel Report and legal  interpretations developed by the Panel, and that it would consider them on  appeal to the extent that this would not require the Appellate Body to solicit  or review new facts.<br />
&nbsp;           </li>
              <li>Peru  argued on appeal that the Panel erred in its interpretation of Article 4.2 of  the Agreement on Agriculture and Article II:1(b) of the GATT 1994 because it  failed to take into account under Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention the  relevant provisions of the FTA and ILC Articles 20 and 45. The Appellate Body <strong>found</strong> that these arguments amounted to arguing that, by means of the FTA, Peru and  Guatemala actually modified these WTO provisions between themselves. In any  event, the Appellate Body considered that both the FTA and ILC&nbsp;Articles&nbsp;20  and 45 were not &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; to the interpretation within the meaning  of Article 31(3)(c), and that the FTA was not a subsequent agreement  &ldquo;regarding the interpretation&rdquo; of the WTO provisions within the  meaning of Article&nbsp;31(3)(a). The Appellate Body also <strong>considered</strong> that such alleged modifications would not be subject to Article 41 of the  Vienna Convention about <em>inter se</em> modifications of multilateral treaties, but rather to the specific WTO  provisions in Article XXIV of the GATT 1994. <br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>The  Appellate Body, therefore, <strong>found</strong> that the Panel did not commit an error  by not interpreting the WTO provisions at issue taking into account the  provisions of the FTA and ILC Articles 20 and 45 under Article 31(3) of the  Vienna Convention.</li></ul>
              <p  class="paranormaltext"><b>Article&nbsp;4.2 of the Agreement on  Agriculture &mdash; &ldquo;minimum import price&rdquo; and &ldquo;similar border  measures&rdquo;</b></p>

                <li>The Appellate Body <strong>rejected</strong> Guatemala's  claim that the Panel erred in its interpretation of &ldquo;minimum import  price&rdquo;. The Appellate Body, however, <strong>found</strong> that the Panel erred in  its analysis of whether the measure at issue is a &ldquo;minimum import price&rdquo;  by not sufficiently engaging with the relevant elements of the design,  structure, and operation of the measure at issue.<br />
&nbsp;                </li>
              <li>The Appellate Body <strong>rejected</strong> Guatemala's  claim that the Panel erred by conflating the legal standards for &ldquo;minimum  import price&rdquo; and &ldquo;similar border measures&rdquo;. The Appellate Body,  however, <strong>found</strong> that the Panel erred in its analysis of whether the  measure is a border measure &ldquo;similar&rdquo; to a &ldquo;minimum import price&rdquo;  by not sufficiently analysing the design, structure and operation of the  measure at issue. <br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>As for  Guatemala's request for completion of the legal analysis, the Appellate Body  concluded that it is <strong>not possible</strong> to complete the legal analysis given that the  Panel record did not contain sufficient undisputed facts concerning to what  extent the explicit or the implicit threshold identified by Guatemala serves as  a minimum import price threshold. </li>

<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 31 July 2015, the DSB adopted the  Appellate Body report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body  report.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 31  August 2015, Peru informed the DSB that, pursuant to Article 21.3 of the DSU,  it intended to implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings in this dispute. On 1 October  2015, Guatemala requested that the reasonable period of time be determined  through binding arbitration pursuant to Article 21.3(c) of the DSU. On 9  October 2015, the parties agreed on Mr Ricardo Ram&iacute;rez-Hern&aacute;ndez to serve as the Arbitrator  pursuant to Article 21.3(c) of the DSU. On 9 October 2015, Mr Ram&iacute;rez-Hern&aacute;ndez  accepted the appointment.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="bkmk457_15" name="bkmk457_15"></a>On 16 December 2015, the  Award of the Arbitrator was circulated to the Members of the WTO. The  Arbitrator determined the reasonable period of time as 7 months and 29 days  from the adoption of the Panel and Appellate Body Reports. The reasonable  period of time will thus expire on 29 March 2016.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 29 March 2016, Peru informed the DSB that, in order to  bring the additional duties resulting from the application of the Price Range  System into line with Peru's WTO obligations, it has revised the Price Range  System in line with the DSB's recommendations. Peru thus informed the DSB that  it had adopted the necessary measures to comply with the recommendations and  rulings in this dispute.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 11  April 2016, Guatemala and Peru informed the DSB of Agreed Procedures under  Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mutually Agreed  Solution</h3>
<p>
  On  23 April  2025, Peru  and Guatemala notified the  DSB that, pursuant to Article 3.6 of the DSU,  they had reached a mutually agreed solution. </p>
