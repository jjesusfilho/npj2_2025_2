		<h3>Consultations</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Japan. </strong></p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 18 November 1999, Japan requested consultations with  the United States in respect of the preliminary and final determinations of the  US Department of Commerce and the US International Trade Commission on the  anti-dumping investigation of Certain Hot Rolled Steel Products from Japan  issued on 25 and 30 November 1998, 12 February 1999, 28 April 1999 and 23 June  1999. Japan considered that these determinations are erroneous and based on  deficient procedures under the US Tariff Act of 1930 and related regulations.  The Japanese complaint also concerned certain provisions of the Tariff Act of  1930 and related regulations. Japan claimed violations of Articles VI and X of  the GATT 1994 and Articles 2, 3, 6 (including Annex II), 9 and 10 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 11 February 2000, Japan requested the establishment  of a panel. At its meeting on 24 February 2000, the DSB deferred the establishment  of a panel. </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> Further to a second request to establish a panel by  Japan, the DSB established a panel at its meeting on 20 March 2000. Brazil,  Canada, Chile, the European Communities and Korea reserved their third-party  rights. On 9 May 2000, Japan requested the Director-General to determine the  composition of the panel. On 24 May 2000, the panel was composed. </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> The panel report was circulated on 28 February 2001.  The panel concluded as follows:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>The United States acted inconsistently with  Articles 6.8 and Annex II of the AD Agreement in its application of &ldquo;facts  available&rdquo; to Kawasaki Steel Corporation (KSC), Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC) and NKK Corporation;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>Section 735(c)(5)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930,  as amended, which mandates that USDOC exclude only margins based entirely on  facts available in determining an all others rate, is inconsistent with Article  9.4 of the AD Agreement, and that therefore the US has acted inconsistently  with its obligations under Article 18.4 of the AD Agreement and Article XVI:4  of the Marrakesh Agreement by failing to bring that provision into conformity  with its obligations under the AD Agreement; and<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>The United States acted inconsistently with  Article 2.1 of the AD Agreement in excluding certain home-market sales to  affiliated parties from the calculation of normal value on the basis of the  &ldquo;arm&rsquo;s length&rdquo; test. In addition, in light of the findings above, the panel  concluded that the replacement of those sales with sales to unaffiliated  downstream purchasers was inconsistent with Article 2.1 of the AD  Agreement.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>With respect to those of Japan&rsquo;s claims not  addressed above the panel concluded: (1) that the claim was not within its  terms of reference (&ldquo;general practice&rdquo; concerning adverse facts available;  &ldquo;general practice&rdquo; of excluding certain home-market sales from the calculation  of normal value), or (2) that, in light of considerations of judicial economy,  it is neither necessary nor appropriate to make findings. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 25 April 2001, the United States notified its  decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the panel  report and certain legal interpretations developed by the panel. The Appellate  Body circulated its Report on 24 July 2001. In this regard, the Appellate Body  upheld the panel&rsquo;s findings except for the following:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>It reversed the panel&rsquo;s finding regarding the  inconsistency with Article 2.1 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement of the United States&rsquo;  methodology for calculating the normal value as regards the using of certain  downstream sales made by an investigated exporters&rsquo; affiliates to dependent  purchasers;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>It found that there was insufficient factual  record to allow completion of the analysis of Japan&rsquo;s claim under Article 2.4  of the Anti-Dumping Agreement that the US did not make a fair comparison in its  use of downstream sales when calculating normal value;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>It reversed the panel&rsquo;s finding that the United States  did not act inconsistently with the Anti-dumping Agreement in its application  of the captive production provision in its determination of injury sustained by  the US hot-rolled steel industry;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>It reversed the panel&rsquo;s finding that the USITC  demonstrated the existence of a causal relationship, under Article 3.5 of the  said agreement, between dumped imports and material injury to that industry;  but found that there was insufficient factual record to allow completion of the  analysis of Japan&rsquo;s claim on causation; </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the panel  report, as modified by the Appellate Body report, on 23 August 2001.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 20 November 2001, Japan requested that the  reasonable period of time for implementation of the DSB&rsquo;s recommendations be  determined by binding arbitration under Article 21.3(c) of the DSU. Pending the  appointment of the arbitrator, Japan and the United States agreed to extend the  time-period for the issuance of the award of the arbitrator insofar as the 90  day-period from the adoption of the DSB's recommendations and rulings foreseen  in Article 21.3 (c) was about to expire. They agreed that the award of the  arbitrator is to be made no later than 19 February 2002. On 19&nbsp;February  2002, the arbitrator circulated his award. The arbitrator concluded that the  reasonable period of time for implementation by the United States of the DSB&rsquo;s  recommendations was 15&nbsp;months from 23 August 2001, i.e. it expired on 23  November 2002.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 22 November 2002, the United States requested the  DSB to modify the reasonable period of time. The United States proposed that  the reasonable period of time be modified so as to expire on 31&nbsp;December  2003, or on the date on which the first session of the next US Congress  adjourns, whichever was earlier. The United States believed that such an  extension of time would promote a principal aim of the dispute settlement  system, which is to provide mutually satisfactory solutions to disputes.&nbsp; At the DSB meeting of 28 November 2002, the United  States stated that it was consulting with Japan and had sought its agreement to  extend the reasonable period of time in this case to 31 December 2003 or the  end of the first session of the next Congress, whichever is earlier. At its  meeting on 5 December 2002, the DSB agreed to the request by the United States  for an extension of the reasonable period of time for the implementation of the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB in this dispute to 31 December 2003. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 21 November 2003, the United States notified the DSB  that it proposed that the reasonable period of time for implementation of the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB be modified so as to expire on 31 July  2004, and that it was consulting with Japan regarding this proposal. At its  meeting on 10 December 2003, the DSB agreed to the request by the United States  for an extension of the reasonable period of time for the implementation of the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 30 July 2004, the United States notified the DSB  that it proposed that the reasonable period of time for implementation of the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB be modified so as to expire on 31 July  2005, and that it had consulted with Japan regarding this proposal. At its  meeting on 31 August 2004, the DSB agreed to the request by the United States  for an extension of the reasonable period of time for the implementation of the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On&nbsp;7&nbsp;July 2005, the  parties to the dispute informed the DSB of an Understanding that Japan retains  its right to be granted DSB authorization to suspend concessions or other  obligations pursuant to Article 22.6 of the DSU at any future date and the  United States will not seek to block Japan&rsquo;s request for DSB authorization on  the grounds that such DSB action would not be within the time period set out in  the first sentence of Article 22.6 of the DSU.</p>
        <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">Following the second extension  of the reasonable period of time which ultimately expired on 31&nbsp;July 2005 (see  above), the United States recalled, in its successive status reports that on 22&nbsp;November  2002, the US Department of Commerce issued a new final determination in the  hot-rolled steel anti-dumping duty investigation that implements the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB with respect to the calculation of  anti-dumping margins in that investigation and that on 19&nbsp;May 2005,  legislation was introduced in the US House of Representatives that would  implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings with respect to the US  anti-dumping duty statute and stating that the US Administration will continue  to work with Congress to enact this legislation. &nbsp;No further actions were notified to the DSB.</p>
        <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">The United States, pursuant  to  Article 21.6 of the DSU, continued to report periodically on  its status of implementation.&nbsp; At the DSB  meeting on 24 May 2011 the United States stated that with respect to the DSB's  recommendations and rulings that had not already been addressed by the US  authorities, the US Administration would work with the US Congress with respect  to appropriate statutory measures that would resolve this matter. Japan took  note of the US report that the United States had taken certain measures to  implement part of the DSB's recommendations in November 2002. As for the  remaining part of the DSB's recommendations, Japan hoped that the United States  would soon be in a position to report to the DSB on more tangible progress.  Japan called on the United States to fully implement the DSB's recommendations  in this long-standing dispute without further delay.</p></div>
