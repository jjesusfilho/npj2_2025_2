        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Chinese Taipei. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 25 June 2014, Chinese Taipei requested consultations  with Canada with respect to the provisional and definitive anti-dumping  measures imposed by Canada on imports of certain carbon steel welded pipe  (CSWP) originating in, among others, Chinese Taipei.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Chinese Taipei claims that the measures are  inconsistent with:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">Articles 1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.7, 5.8, 6.8,  6.10, 18 and Annex II of the Anti-Dumping Agreement;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">Article VI of the GATT 1994.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 7 November 2014, Chinese Taipei requested  further consultations. In addition to the  measures listed in the original request for consultations, Chinese Taipei  claimed that the  measures were also inconsistent with Articles 2.2, 7.1(ii),  7.5, 9.2 and 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </p>
        <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">On 22 January 2015, Chinese Taipei requested the  establishment of a panel. At  its meeting on 23&nbsp;February  2015, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>

        <h3> Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> At  its meeting on 10 March 2015, the DSB established a panel. China, the  European Union, Korea, Norway, the United Arab Emirates and  the United States reserved their third-party rights. Subsequently,  Brazil reserved its third-party rights.

        <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">On 11 November 2015, the Chair of the panel  informed the DSB that the beginning of the panel's work was delayed as a result  of a lack of available experienced lawyers in the Secretariat.

    	    <p>This  dispute concerned the anti-dumping measures imposed by Canada on certain CSWP  from Chinese Taipei, as well as certain provisions of Canada's underlying  legislation. Chinese Taipei brought a number of claims in respect of Canada's  treatment of exporters with <em>de minimis</em> margins of dumping. Chinese Taipei also claimed that Canada had failed to  undertake a non-attribution analysis in respect of the effect of subsidization  of certain dumped imports and the effect of overcapacity in the domestic  industry. Chinese Taipei also challenged the use of facts available for  establishing the dumping margin and duty rate for imports from non-cooperating  exporters from Chinese Taipei. Chinese Taipei pursued several claims concerning  the imposition of anti-dumping duties on imports of new product types or models  for which prospective normal values had not been established during the  original investigation. Chinese Taipei's &ldquo;as such&rdquo; claims concerned  certain provisions of Canada's anti-dumping legislation which relate to the  treatment of exporters with <em>de minimis</em> margins of dumping.</p>
            <p><strong>Claims concerning the  treatment of exporters with <em>de minimis</em> margins of dumping</strong></p>
            <p>Chinese Taipei claimed that, contrary to the  second sentence of Article 5.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, Canada had failed  to immediately terminate the investigation in respect of Chinese Taipei  exporters with final <em>de minimis</em> margins of dumping. The Panel considered that the term &ldquo;margin of  dumping&rdquo; requires immediate termination of an investigation in respect of  exporters that have individual <em>de minimis</em> margins of dumping, rather than in respect of country-wide margins of dumping  that are <em>de minimis</em>. The Panel  reached this conclusion for contextual considerations and for lack of cogent  reasons to depart from the panel and Appellate Body findings in Mexico &mdash; Anti-Dumping Measures on Rice regarding the same issue. The Panel therefore upheld Chinese Taipei's claim. </p>
            <p>Chinese  Taipei also claimed that Canada had failed to comply with the requirement in  the first sentence of Article 6.10 to determine a single margin of dumping for  each known exporter when it based the <em>de  minimis</em> test provided for in Article 5.8 on a country-wide margin of  dumping. The Panel rejected this claim because it found that it lacked any factual  and legal foundations.</p>
            <p>Chinese  Taipei claimed that Canada acted inconsistently with Article 7.1(ii) by  imposing provisional measures on imports from a Chinese Taipei exporter with a  preliminary margin of dumping below the <em>de  minimis</em> threshold set forth in Article 5.8. The Panel considered that the  term &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; in Article 7.1(ii) does not contain a <em>de minimis</em> element and therefore  rejected Chinese Taipei's claim.</p>
            <p>Chinese  Taipei also contended that the imposition of provisional and definitive  anti-dumping duties on imports from exporters with <em>de minimis</em> margins of dumping was inconsistent with Articles 1,  7.5, and 9.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, and Article VI:2 of the GATT 1994.  The Panel considered that, as a result of the obligation to immediately  terminate the investigation pursuant to Article 5.8, it follows that exporters  with final <em>de minimis</em> margins of  dumping should not be treated as &ldquo;sources found to be dumped&rdquo; for the  purpose of duty imposition under Article 9.2. With regard to the imposition of  definitive anti-dumping measures, the Panel therefore upheld Chinese Taipei's  claims under Article 9.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, as well as under  Article 1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT 1994. In light  of its findings under Article 7.1(ii), the Panel considered that at the stage  of its preliminary determination Canada was entitled to treat exporters with  preliminary <em>de minimis</em> margins of  dumping as &ldquo;sources found to be dumped&rdquo;. It thus rejected Chinese  Taipei's claims under Article 7.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, as well as  under Article 1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT  1994.</p>
            <p>Chinese  Taipei challenged Canada's treatment of imports from Chinese Taipei exporters  with final <em>de minimis</em> margins of  dumping as &ldquo;dumped imports&rdquo; within the meaning of Article 3.1, 3.2,  3.4, 3.5 and 3.7 for the purpose of the determinations of injury and causation.  The Panel upheld Chinese Taipei's claim. It found that as a result of the  requirement to immediately terminate the investigation with respect to  exporters with final <em>de minimis</em> margins of dumping, imports from such exporters should not be treated as  &ldquo;dumped&rdquo; in the analysis and final determinations of injury and  causation. </p>
            <p><strong>Claim regarding the non-attribution analysis</strong></p>
            <p>Chinese  Taipei claimed that Canada had failed, contrary to Article 3.5, to conduct a  non-attribution analysis in respect of the effect of subsidization of certain  dumped imports from India as well as the effect of overcapacity in the domestic  industry. The Panel rejected Chinese Taipei's claim. It found, on textual and  contextual grounds, that there is no requirement under Article 3.5 to separate  the effect of subsidization from the effect of the dumping. It also found that  Chinese Taipei had not established that overcapacity was an injurious factor  &ldquo;known&rdquo; to the Canadian investigating authority that should have been  examined pursuant to the non-attribution requirement.</p>
            <p><strong>Claim regarding the use of facts available</strong></p>
            <p>Chinese Taipei  challenged the way in which Canada used facts available for determining the  dumping margin and duty rate for imports from non-cooperating exporters from  Chinese Taipei, namely by relying on the highest transaction-specific amount of  dumping for a cooperative exporter from any country subject to the  investigation. The Panel upheld Chinese Taipei's claim. It found that Canada  had applied facts available without undertaking a comparative evaluation and  assessment of all the available facts on the record, contrary to Article 6.8  and Annex II, paragraph&nbsp;7. </p>
            <p><strong>Claims concerning the imposition of  anti-dumping duties on imports of new product types or models</strong></p>
            <p>Canada uses  a prospective normal value system for imposing anti-dumping duties. Chinese  Taipei pursued several claims concerning Canada's imposition of anti-dumping  duties on imports of new product types or models from investigated and  cooperative exporters from Chinese Taipei for which prospective normal values  had not been established during the original investigation. In particular,  Chinese Taipei challenged the imposition of these anti-dumping duties under  Article 9.3 as in excess of those exporters' margins of dumping as established  under Article 2. The Panel considered that the chapeau of Article 9.3 establishes  a fundamental link between the amount of the anti-dumping duty imposed or  collected in respect of a given exporter and a margin of dumping established  for that exporter. By applying anti-dumping duties on imports of new product  types or models for investigated and cooperative exporters on the basis of the  residual duty rate established for &ldquo;all other exporters&rdquo;, rather than  using the margins of dumping established during the investigation for the  particular exporters at issue, or updating their margins of dumping, the Panel  found Canada to have failed to preserve this fundamental link, thereby acting  inconsistently with Article 9.3. The Panel thus upheld Chinese Taipei's claim.  Chinese Taipei also claimed that Canada violated Article 6.8 and Annex II by  resorting to facts available for the calculation of the duty rate for imports  of new product models or types from cooperating Chinese Taipei exporters. The  Panel upheld this claim because Canada had not applied facts available on the  basis of the conditions set forth in Article 6.8 and Annex II. It also saw no basis  for using facts available outside of those conditions. The Panel did not find  it necessary to address additional claims by Chinese Taipei under Articles 2.2  and 6.10. </p>
            <p><strong>&ldquo;As such&rdquo; claims</strong></p>
            <p>Chinese  Taipei also brought challenges against certain provisions of Canada's  underlying anti-dumping legislation, the SIMA and SIMR, under Articles 1, 3.1,  3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.7, 5.8, 7.1(ii), 7.5, 9.2 and 18.4 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement, Articles VI and VI:2 of the GATT 1994, and Article XVI:4 of the  Marrakesh Agreement. These &ldquo;as such&rdquo; claims concern the treatment of  exporters with <em>de minimis</em> margins of  dumping and mirror the corresponding &ldquo;as applied&rdquo; claims above. In  particular, the Panel rejected Canada's contention that discretion existed  under the SIMA to immediately terminate investigations in respect of exporters  with <em>de minimis</em> margins of dumping,  as required by Article 5.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. As a result, Chinese  Taipei's claims were upheld to the extent that they relate to the treatment of  exporters with final <em>de minimis</em> margins of dumping, but rejected to the extent that they relate to the  treatment of exporters with preliminary <em>de  minimis</em> margins of dumping.</p>
