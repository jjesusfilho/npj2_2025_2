        <h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Mexico.&nbsp;  </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 26 May 2006, Mexico requested consultations with the United States concerning a series of final anti-dumping determinations by the US Department of Commerce concerning imports of stainless steel sheet and strip in coils from Mexico for the period between January 1999 and June 2004.&nbsp; It also addresses: (i) certain sections of the US Tariff Act of 1930, as amended;&nbsp; (ii) the Statement of Administrative Action that accompanied the Uruguay Round Agreements;&nbsp; (iii) specific sections of the US Department of Commerce&rsquo;s regulations codified at Title 19 of the US Code of Federal Regulations;&nbsp; (iv) the 1997 edition of the Import Administration Antidumping Manual; and (v) the methodology employed by the US Department of Commerce to determine the overall margin of dumping for the product subject to the original investigation and administrative reviews, whereby the Department disregarded (&ldquo;zeroed&rdquo;) negative dumping margins. </p>        <p class="paranormaltext">Mexico considers that the above laws, regulations, administrative practices and methodologies both &ldquo;as such&rdquo; and as applied in the above determinations resulted in the nullification and impairment of benefits directly or indirectly accruing to Mexico under the WTO Agreement and the Agreements annexed thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, Mexico claims that the US laws, regulations, administrative practices, methodologies and determinations in question are inconsistent at least with: </p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994;
            <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <li>Articles 1, 2.1, 2.4, 2.4.2, 5, 6.10, 9 (including but not limited to 9.3), 11 and 18 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement;&nbsp; and
            <br>
&nbsp;
          <li>Article XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 9 June 2006, Japan requested to join the consultations.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext"> On 12 October 2006, Mexico requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 26 October 2006, the DSB established a panel. Chile, China, the European Communities, Japan and Thailand reserved their third-party rights. On 15 December 2006, Mexico requested the Director-General to compose the Panel. On 20 December 2006, the Director-General composed the Panel. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 21 May 2007, the Chairman of the Panel informed the DSB that the Panel would not be able to complete its work in six months in light of scheduling conflicts and that it expected to complete its work in November 2007.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 20 December 2007, the Panel report was circulated to Members. The Panel concluded that:&nbsp; (a) model zeroing in investigations <em>as such </em> is inconsistent with Article&nbsp;2.4.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement;&nbsp; (b) the USDOC acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;2.4.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement in the investigation on Stainless Steel Sheet and Strips in Coils from Mexico by using model zeroing;&nbsp; (c) simple zeroing in periodic reviews is <em>as such </em> not inconsistent with Article&nbsp;VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994 and Articles 2.1, 9.3 and 2.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement;&nbsp; and (d) the USDOC did not act inconsistently with Article&nbsp;VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994 and Articles 2.1, 9.3 and 2.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement by using simple zeroing in the five periodic reviews on Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip in Coils from Mexico. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The&nbsp;Panel applied judicial economy with regard to Mexico's claims under: (a) Article&nbsp;VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994 and Articles 2.1, 2.4 and 18.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article&nbsp;XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement regarding model zeroing in investigations;&nbsp; and (b) Article&nbsp;XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement and Article&nbsp;18.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement regarding simple zeroing in periodic reviews. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 31 January 2008, Mexico notified its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the Panel report and certain legal interpretations developed by the Panel. On 26 March 2008, the Chairman of the Appellate Body informed the DSB that it would not be able to provide its report within 60 days due to the time required for completion and translation. It was estimated that the report will be circulated no later than 30 April 2008. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 30 April 2008, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members. The Appellate Body: </p>
        <ol>
          <li class="paranormaltext">reversed the Panel's finding that simple zeroing in periodic review is not, as such, inconsistent with Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994 and Articles 2.1, 2.4 and 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement;&nbsp; and found, instead, that simple zeroing in periodic reviews is, as such, inconsistent with Article&nbsp;VI:2 of the GATT 1994 and Article&nbsp;9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement; <br>
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">reversed the Panel's finding that the United States did not act inconsistently with Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994 and Articles 2.1, 2.4 and 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement;&nbsp; and found, instead, that the United States acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;VI:2 of the GATT 1994 and Article&nbsp;9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement by applying simple zeroing in the five periodic reviews at issue in this dispute; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">found it unnecessary, for purposes of resolving this dispute, to make an additional finding on Mexico's claim that simple zeroing in periodic reviews is, as such, and as applied in the five periodic reviews at issue in this dispute, inconsistent with Article&nbsp;2.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, and on Mexico's related claim under Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU;&nbsp; and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">did not make an additional finding that the Panel failed to discharge its duties under Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU by making findings that contradict those in previous Appellate Body reports adopted by the DSB. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body recommended that the DSB request the United States to bring its measures, found in the Appellate Body report, and in the Panel report as modified by the Appellate Body report, to be inconsistent with the GATT 1994 and with the Anti-Dumping Agreement, into conformity with its obligations under those Agreements. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 20 May 2008, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the Panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body report.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
			  <h3>Implementation  of adopted reports</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 2 June 2008, the United States notified the DSB that it intended to comply with its WTO obligations and stated that it would need a reasonable period of time for implementation. On 11 August 2008, Mexico requested that the reasonable period of time be determined through binding arbitration pursuant to Article 21.3(c). On 22 August 2008, Mexico requested the Director-General to appoint the arbitrator.&nbsp; On 29 August 2008,&nbsp;the Director-General appointed Mr Feliciano to act as arbitrator.&nbsp; On 1 September 2008, Mr Feliciano accepted the appointment of arbitrator. On 31 October 2008, the arbitration award was circulated to Members.&nbsp; The arbitrator determined that the reasonable period of time for the United States to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings is 11 months plus ten days from the date of adoption of the Panel and Appellate Body reports.&nbsp; The reasonable period of time will expire on 30 April 2009. </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">The reasonable period of time expired on 30 April 2009.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Compliance  proceedings</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext">On 18&nbsp;May   2009, Mexico  and the United States  informed the DSB of an Agreement Regarding Procedures under Articles 21 and 22  of the DSU.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 19 August 2009,  Mexico  requested consultations under Article 21.5 of the DSU.&nbsp; On 28   August 2009, Japan  requested to join the consultations. On 7 September  2010, Mexico requested the establishment of a  compliance panel. At its meeting  on 21 September 2010, the DSB agreed to refer to the original panel, if  possible, the matter raised by Mexico pertaining to this dispute.&nbsp; China, the European Union, Japan and Korea  reserved their third-party rights.&nbsp;  Subsequently, Brazil reserved its third-party rights.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">Due  to the unavailability of one of the original panelists, the parties agreed on a  replacement panelist.  The compliance panel was composed  on 13 May 2011. On 9 November 2011, the Chair  of the compliance panel informed the DSB  that the timetable adopted by the compliance panel after consultation with the  parties envisaged that the final report would be issued to parties by March  2012.  The compliance panel  expected to conclude its work within that  time-frame. On 27 April 2012, the  Chair of the compliance panel informed the DSB that the compliance  panel had agreed to   Mexico's request  of the same day, to  suspend its work  in accordance with Article 12.12 of the DSU,   until  14 May 2012.  The Chair of the compliance panel informed the DSB on 14  May and 31 May 2012, that the panel had accepted  Mexico's subsequent requests   of the same dates  that the  compliance panel  suspend  its work until 31 May 2012 and  until further notice, respectively. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 6 May 2013, the panel circulated its report to  the Members. In accordance with Article 12.7 of the DSU, given  that the parties had reached a mutually satisfactory solution  dated 8 April 2013, the  panel report was confined to a brief description of the case and to reporting  that a solution has been reached.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Settled or terminated</h3>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 8 April 2013, Mexico and the United States notified  the DSB, in accordance with Article&nbsp;3.6 of the DSU, that the parties had  reached a mutually satisfactory solution.</p></div>
