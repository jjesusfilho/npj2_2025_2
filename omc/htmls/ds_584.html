         <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Japan</strong> <!--(See also <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds..._e.htm">DS...</a>)--></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 10  May 2019, Japan requested consultations with India regarding the tariff  treatment that India allegedly accords to certain goods (telephones for  cellular networks or for other wireless networks; base stations; machines for  the reception, conversion and transmission or regeneration of voice, images or  other data, including switching and routing apparatus; and parts of telephone  sets and other apparatus for the transmission or reception of voice, images or  other data).</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Japan  claimed that the measures at issue appear to be inconsistent with Articles  II:1(a) and II:1(b) of the GATT 1994.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 15 May 2019, the United States requested to  join the consultations. On 16 May 2019, Chinese Taipei requested to join the  consultations. On 17 May 2019, Canada and Singapore requested to join the  consultations. On 21 May 2019, China, the European Union and Thailand requested  to join the consultations.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel  and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p>On 19 March 2020, Japan requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 29 June 2020, the DSB  deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">At its  meeting on 29 July 2020, the DSB established a panel. Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Indonesia,  Korea, Norway, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Chinese Taipei,  Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States reserved their  third-party rights.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">Following  agreement of the parties, the panel was composed on 7 October 2020.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 4 March 2021,  the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that, in accordance with the timetable  adopted following consultations with the parties, the panel estimated that  it would issue its final report to the parties in the second  quarter of 2022. In its communication, the Chair apprised the DSB that the  report would be available to the public once it was circulated to the Members  in all three official languages, and that the date of circulation depends on  completion of translation.&nbsp;On 29 June  2022, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that  the COVID-19 pandemic and related travel and other restrictions caused further  delays in the proceedings and, as  a result, the panel estimated that it would issue its final  report to the parties not before the end of 2022. On  16 December 2022, the Chair of the panel informed  the DSB that due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that  the same panelists have been appointed in this dispute and in two other  disputes (DS582  and DS588),  the panel now estimated that it would issue  its final report to the parties in the first quarter of 2023.</p>
         <p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="bkmk584r" name="bkmk584r"></a>On 17 April 2023, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
    	    <p>Japan challenged the tariff treatment that India  accorded to certain information communications technology (ICT) products  falling under the following tariff items of India's First Schedule: 8517.12.11,  8517.12.19, 8517.12.90, 8517.61.00, 8517.62.90, 8517.70.10 and 8517.70.90. </p>
            <p>Japan claimed that these measures lead, or led at  the time of the Panel's establishment, to the application of ordinary customs  duties in excess of those set forth in India's Schedule of Concessions, and, therefore,  are or were inconsistent with Articles II:1(a) and (b) of the GATT 1994. Japan  also claimed that even where India unconditionally exempts certain products  from customs duties, India acts inconsistently with Article II:1(a) because  India grants those exemptions through customs notifications which are subject  to the possibility of repeal at any time, thus creating a lack of  foreseeability for traders.</p>
            <p>India argued that: (i) its binding tariff  commitments are set forth in the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), and those  commitments are static and did not change due to their incorporation into  India's WTO Schedule; (ii) pursuant to Article 48 of the Vienna Convention on  the Law of Treaties (Vienna Convention), aspects of India's WTO Schedule are  invalid as a consequence of an error on the part of India during the  transposition of its Schedule from the HS2002 to the HS2007; and (iii) the  errors in India's WTO Schedule are of a formal nature and were therefore  capable of rectification pursuant to the 1980 Decision, such that Japan's  objection to India's proposed rectification of its Schedule is inconsistent  with the requirements of the 1980 Decision. India also raised several arguments  concerning the nature of the conditions attached to certain tariff treatment,  as well as the tariff classification of certain products. India further argued  that pursuant to the India-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement  (CEPA), and the implementing notification thereof, India exempts from ordinary  customs duties the products at issue when originating from Japan, and therefore  accords to products of Japan tariff treatment that is consistent with India's  duty-free tariff commitments set forth in its WTO Schedule. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>General issues concerning India's WTO tariff commitments</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Panel rejected India's assertions  that its binding tariff commitments are set forth in the ITA, and found that:  (i) the ITA is not a covered agreement within the meaning of the WTO Agreement  and the DSU; and (ii) the ITA is not the source of India's legal obligations in  these disputes. The Panel also held that India's WTO tariff commitments are not  static in nature.</li>
              <li>The Panel further found that India did  not satisfy the requirements of Article 48 of the Vienna Convention. The Panel  accepted in good faith India's argument that at the time of the transposition  of its HS2002 Schedule into its HS2007 Schedule, India had assumed that the  scope of its WTO commitments was limited to the scope of its ITA undertakings  and that the scope of those tariff commitments would not be expanded through  the HS2007 transposition process. However, the Panel found that India had  failed to demonstrate that this assumption constituted an essential basis of  India's consent to be bound by the certified Schedule. The Panel also found that  India was put on notice of the possibility that its WTO tariff commitments in  its HS2007 Schedule may have expanded from those set forth in its HS2002  Schedule, and similarly, that its WTO tariff commitments in its HS2007 Schedule  may have expanded from those set forth in the ITA. Thus, even if Article 48  applied in WTO dispute settlement (which the Panel did not consider it  necessary to address), the circumstances did not satisfy the requirements of  Articles 48(1) and (2) of the Vienna Convention. </li>
              <li>The Panel further declined to make  findings on India's request that the Panel find that Japan violated paragraph 3  of the 1980 Decision by raising objections to India's requested rectification  unfounded in law, and thereby impeded India's rights to make a formal  rectification to its schedule of concessions under the 1980 Decision. The Panel  found that India's requests were claims, not affirmative defences, and  therefore fell outside the Panel's terms of reference. The Panel also  considered that, even if it made findings on this issue, to the extent that  there remained objections on record to India's rectification request (including  those by WTO Members who were not parties to this dispute), India's WTO  Schedule would remain unmodified, and the findings requested by India would not  modify India's WTO obligations as set forth in its WTO Schedule. </li>
              <li>Thus, the Panel found that India's WTO  tariff commitments, for purposes of applying Articles II:1(a) and (b) of the  GATT 1994, are set forth in its WTO Schedule.</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left"><strong>Articles II:1(a)  and (b) of the GATT 1994</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The  Panel found that: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>India's tariff treatment of products falling under  tariff items 8517.12.11 and 8517.12.19 of India's First Schedule at the time of  the Panel's establishment, and which presently fall under tariff items  8517.13.00 and 8517.14.00 of India's First Schedule, is inconsistent with  Article II:1(b), first sentence, because such products are subject to ordinary  customs duties in excess of those set forth in India's WTO Schedule. The Panel  also found that India's tariff treatment of such products is less favourable  than that provided in its WTO Schedule, such that India is acting  inconsistently with Article II:1(a) of the GATT 1994.</li>
              <li>India's tariff treatment of products falling under  tariff items 8517.61.00 and 8517.62.90 of India's First Schedule is  inconsistent with Article II:1(b), first sentence, because such products are  subject to ordinary customs duties in excess of those set forth in India's WTO  Schedule. The Panel also found that India's tariff treatment of such products  is less favourable than that provided in its WTO Schedule, such that India is  acting inconsistently with Article II:1(a) of the GATT 1994.</li>
              <li>India's tariff treatment of products falling under  tariff items 8517.70.10 and 8517.70.90 of India's First Schedule at the time of  the Panel's establishment, and which presently fall under tariff items 8517.71.00,  8517.79.10, and 8517.79.90 of India's First Schedule, is inconsistent with  Article II:1(b), first sentence, because: (i) certain such products are subject  to ordinary customs duties in excess of those set forth in India's WTO  Schedule; and (ii) certain such products are subject to ordinary customs duties  in excess of those set forth in India's WTO Schedule unless they satisfy  certain conditions that are not set forth in that WTO Schedule. The Panel also  found that India's tariff treatment of such products is less favourable than  that provided in its WTO Schedule, such that India is acting inconsistently  with Article II:1(a) of the GATT 1994.</li>
              <li>India accords unconditional duty-free treatment to  products falling under tariff item 8517.12.90 of India's First Schedule at the  time of the Panel's establishment, and which presently fall under tariff item  8517.14.00 of India's First Schedule, in accordance with the terms of its WTO  Schedule, and is therefore acting consistently with Article II:1(b), first  sentence of the GATT 1994. The Panel also found that by according to the  commerce of Japan treatment no less favourable than that provided in its WTO  Schedule, India's tariff treatment of such products is consistent with Article  II:1(a) of the GATT 1994. </li>
              <li>Japan failed to demonstrate that, even where India  accords products at issue treatment that is consistent with Article II:1(b) of  the GATT 1994, the measures at issue in this dispute accord treatment less  favourable than that set forth in India's WTO Schedule, inconsistent with  Article II:1(a) of the GATT 1994, on the ground that India's customs  notifications lack foreseeability or predictability, thus affecting conditions  of competition for traders. </li>
              <li>India failed to establish that Notification No.  69/2011 implementing the CEPA brings India into compliance with its WTO  obligations pursuant to Articles II:1(a) and (b) of the GATT 1994. The Panel found  that for products of Japan to access duty free treatment as set forth in  India's WTO Schedule, they must satisfy preferential rules of origin which are  not set forth in that Schedule, such that this notification does not accord  unconditional duty-free treatment to the products at issue, and therefore does  not bring India into consistency with its obligations under Articles II:1(a)  and (b) of the GATT 1994. </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

<p>On  17 May 2023, India notified the  DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law and  legal interpretations in the panel report. On  22 May 2023, in a  communication addressed to the DSB, Japan indicated that,  given the current situation of non-operation of the Appellate Body, it  considered that all the procedural  deadlines set out in the Appellate Body's Working  Procedures were deemed to be  suspended. Japan further indicated that,  until the Appellate Body resumes its operation and sets the schedule for this  appeal, Japan reserved  its full rights to file its own appeal on errors (if any) in issues of law  covered in the panel  report and legal  interpretations developed by the Panel and submit any relevant submissions for  the case.</p>
