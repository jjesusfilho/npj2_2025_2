        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Viet Nam. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 16 February 2012, Viet Nam requested consultations  with the United States concerning a number of anti-dumping measures on certain  frozen warmwater shrimp from Viet Nam.&nbsp;  In addition to two administrative reviews and the five year &ldquo;sunset  review&rdquo;, the request for consultations concerns several US&nbsp;laws,  regulations, administrative proceedings and practices, including zeroing.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Viet Nam considers that these measures are inconsistent  with the United States' obligations under:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>Articles I:1, VI:1, VI:2 and X:3(a) of the GATT  1994;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>Articles 1, 2.1, 2.4, 2.4.2, 6, 9, 11, 17.6(i)  and Annex II of the Anti-Dumping Agreement;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>Article XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement; <br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>Articles 3.7, 19.1, 21.1, 21.3 and 21.5 of the  DSU;&nbsp; and<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>Viet Nam's Protocol of Accession.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 17 January 2013, Viet Nam requested the  establishment of a panel.&nbsp; At its meeting  on 28&nbsp;January&nbsp;2013, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 27 February 2013, the DSB established  a panel.&nbsp; China, the European Union, Japan,  Norway and Thailand reserved their third-party rights.&nbsp; Subsequently, Ecuador reserved its  third-party rights. Following the agreement of the parties, the panel was  composed on 12 July 2013. On 30 January 2014, the Chair of the panel informed  the DSB that the panel expected to issue its  final report to  the parties by 30 September 2014.</p>
     <p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="bkmk429r" name="bkmk429r"></a>On 17 November 2014, the report of the panel was circulated to Members. The panel found that certain of the measures challenged by Viet Nam are inconsistent with the GATT 1994 and the Anti-Dumping Agreement, and recommends that the United States bring the relevant measures into conformity with its obligations under these Agreements. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p class="paranormaltext">The  dispute concerns anti-dumping measures imposed by the United States against  imports of certain shrimp products from Viet Nam (hereafter referred to as the <em>Shrimp</em> proceedings and anti-dumping duty  order), as well as certain US laws or practices concerning the imposition of  anti-dumping measures and the implementation of adverse DSB recommendations and  rulings in trade remedy cases. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">Viet  Nam made claims with respect to:</p>
            <ol type="i">
              <li class="paranormaltext">the  USDOC's use of the &ldquo;simple zeroing&rdquo; methodology, in administrative  reviews, which Viet Nam argued was, &ldquo;as such&rdquo; and &ldquo;as  applied&rdquo; in the fourth, fifth and sixth administrative reviews under the <em>Shrimp</em> order, inconsistent with Article  9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT 1994;<br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li class="paranormaltext">the  USDOC's practice, in anti-dumping proceedings involving imports from NMEs, of  assigning a rate to the &ldquo;NME-wide entity&rdquo; comprised of  producers/exporters that do not demonstrate sufficient independence from  government control, which Viet Nam argued was, &ldquo;as such&rdquo;, and &ldquo;as  applied&rdquo; in the fourth, fifth and sixth administrative reviews,  inconsistent with Articles 6.10, 9.2, 9.4 and 6.8 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement;<br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li class="paranormaltext">Section  129(c)(1) of the URAA which, in Viet Nam's view, precluded US authorities from  implementing DSB recommendations and rulings with respect to entries made prior  to, and that remained &ldquo;unliquidated&rdquo; on, that date (&ldquo;prior  unliquidated entries&rdquo;), in a manner that was inconsistent, &ldquo;as such&rdquo;,  with Articles 1, 9.2, 9.3, 11.1 and 18.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement;<br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li class="paranormaltext">the  USDOC's reliance on margins of dumping calculated with zeroing, and its failure  to properly establish the facts and to conduct an objective evaluation in the  first sunset review under the<em> Shrimp</em> order, which Viet Nam argued was inconsistent with Articles 11.3 and 17.6 of  the Anti-Dumping Agreement; and<br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li class="paranormaltext">the  USDOC's failure to revoke the anti-dumping duty order with respect to certain  companies that, in Viet Nam's view, had demonstrated the absence of dumping in  the third, fourth and fifth administrative reviews, in violation of Articles  11.1 and 11.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The  United States requested that the Panel reject Viet Nam's claims and that it  find, by way of preliminary ruling, that certain claims set forth by Viet Nam  in its request for the establishment of a panel fell outside the Panel's terms  of reference.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Preliminary  ruling addressing jurisdictional objections by the United States</strong></p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">On  26 September 2013, the Panel issued a preliminary ruling in which it rejected  the US argument that the sixth administrative review was not within its terms  of reference. The Panel declined to make any ruling with respect to the  remaining objections raised by the United States in light of Viet Nam's indication  that it was not pursuing the corresponding claims.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Claims with  respect to zeroing in administrative reviews</strong></p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">With  respect to Viet Nam's &ldquo;as such&rdquo; claim concerning zeroing in  administrative reviews, taking into account the fact that, as of April 2012,  the USDOC had modified its calculation methodology in administrative reviews,  the Panel found that Viet Nam had failed to establish the existence of the  alleged measure as a rule or norm of general and prospective application. Consequently,  the Panel rejected Viet Nam's claims of inconsistency under Article 9.3 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT 1994.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">With  respect to Viet Nam's &ldquo;as applied&rdquo; claims, the Panel found that the  USDOC had used zeroing to calculate the dumping margins of  individually-examined Vietnamese producers/exporters in the three  administrative reviews at issue and that by doing so, had acted inconsistently  with Article 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT  1994. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Claims with  respect to the USDOC's NME-wide entity rate practice</strong></p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The  Panel found, with respect to Viet Nam's claims concerning the USDOC's NME-wide  entity rate practice, that Viet Nam had successfully established the existence  of the NME-wide entity rate practice as a rule or norm of general and  prospective application which could be challenged &ldquo;as such&rdquo; as Viet  Nam had demonstrated that, in anti-dumping proceedings involving NME countries,  the USDOC applies a rebuttable presumption that all companies within a NME  country belong to a single, NME-wide entity and assigns a single rate to that  entity, and thus to companies deemed to belong to that entity. The Panel found  that this measure was &ldquo;as such&rdquo;, and &ldquo;as applied&rdquo; in the  fourth, fifth and sixth administrative reviews inconsistent with Articles 6.10 and  9.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The  Panel found that Viet Nam had not established that there existed a USDOC  practice amounting to a rule or norm of general and prospective application with  respect to the manner in which the NME-wide entity rate is calculated, in  particular concerning the use of facts available. Consequently, the Panel  rejected Viet Nam's claim that this alleged measure was inconsistent, &ldquo;as  such&rdquo;, with Articles 6.8, 9.4 and Annex II of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. However  the Panel found that the rate applied to the Viet Nam-wide entity and its  constituent companies in the administrative reviews at issue was inconsistent with  Article 9.4. It rejected Viet Nam's claims that the same rate violated Article  6.8 and Annex II.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Claims with  respect to Section 129(c)(1) of the URAA</strong></p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The  Panel concluded that Viet Nam had failed to establish its factual allegation  that Section 129(c)(1) of the URAA precludes implementation of DSB  recommendations by the US authorities with respect to prior unliquidated  entries. This being the case, the Panel rejected Viet Nam's claims concerning  this provision of US law. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Claims with  respect to the USDOC's determination in the sunset review</strong></p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">In  its assessment of Viet Nam's claims with respect to USDOC's determination in  the sunset review, the Panel agreed with the conclusions of panels and the  Appellate Body in prior disputes that, should an investigating authority choose  to rely upon dumping margins in making a likelihood-of-dumping determination,  the calculation of those margins must conform to the disciplines of the covered  agreements or a violation of Article 11.3 ensues. The Panel found that the  USDOC had relied, in its likelihood-of-dumping determination, on certain  margins that had been determined inconsistently with provisions of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and the GATT 1994, in particular individual dumping  margins calculated with zeroing and the Viet Nam-wide entity rate. The Panel  concluded that the USDOC's reliance on WTO-inconsistent margins rendered its  likelihood-of-dumping determination inconsistent with Article 11.3. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Claims with  respect to company-specific revocations</strong></p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">In  examining Viet Nam's claims with respect to company-specific revocations, the  Panel noted that Article 11.2 imposes an obligation on authorities to conduct a  review of the need for the continued imposition of the duty where: (i) a  request is submitted by an interested party; (ii) after a reasonable period of  time has elapsed; (iii) requesting that the investigating authority examine one  of the three matters specified in the second sentence of Article 11.2; and (iv)  the request is accompanied by positive information substantiating the need for  a review. The Panel found that although requests submitted by Vietnamese  producers/exporters in the context of the fourth and fifth administrative  reviews satisfied these conditions, for some of the requests, the USDOC made a  determination not to revoke the order but did not undertake any consideration  of the need for the continued imposition of the duty to offset dumping, on the  basis that the producer/exporter requesting revocation was not being individually  examined in the administrative review at issue. On this basis, the Panel upheld  Viet Nam's claim that the USDOC's treatment of the requests for revocation  submitted by Vietnamese producers/exporters not selected for individual  examination contravened Article 11.2. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The  Panel further considered that if an authority elects to rely on the existence  of dumping margins in the determination foreseen under Article 11.2, then, the  margins it relies upon must have been determined consistently with the  disciplines of the covered agreements. Given that, in the proceedings at issue,  the USDOC had relied on margins of dumping calculated with zeroing in its  consideration of some revocation requests, the Panel upheld Viet Nam's claim  with respect to the USDOC's treatment of these requests.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
 <p class="paranormaltext">On 6 January 2015, Viet Nam  notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues  of law and legal interpretation in the panel report.</p>
       <p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="bkmk429abr" name="bkmk429abr"></a>On 7  April 2015, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members. </p>
<div aria-multiselectable="true" class="panel-group accordion" role="tablist">

      </div>
      <div aria-labelledby="headingTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseB" role="tabpanel">
          <div class="panel-body">

<p class="paranormaltext">In its appeal, Viet Nam claimed that the Panel acted inconsistently with its obligations under Article 11 of the DSU, in finding that Viet Nam had failed to establish that Section 129(c)(1) precludes &ldquo;extending the benefits of implementation&rdquo; to prior unliquidated entries, and therefore concluding that Viet Nam had not established that Section 129(c)(1) is inconsistent &ldquo;as such&rdquo; with Articles 1, 9.2, 9.3, 11.1, and 18.1 of the Anti Dumping Agreement. The Appellate Body rejected Viet Nam's claim that the Panel acted inconsistently with Article 11 of the DSU. Consequently, the Appellate Body upheld the Panel's finding that Viet Nam had not established that Section 129(c)(1) is inconsistent “as such” with Articles 1, 9.2, 9.3, 11.1, and 18.1 of the Anti Dumping Agreement.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div></div>
<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on  22 April 2015, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the panel report,  as upheld by the Appellate Body report.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">At the DSB meeting on 20 May 2015, the United States  informed the DSB that it intended to implement the DSB's recommendations and  rulings in a manner that respects its WTO obligations. The United States added  that it would need a reasonable period of time in which to do so. On 17  September 2015, Viet Nam requested that the reasonable period of time be  determined through binding arbitration pursuant to Article&nbsp;21.3(c) of the  DSU. On 7 October 2015, the parties agreed on Mr Simon Farbenbloom to serve as  the Arbitrator pursuant to Article 21.3(c) of the DSU. On 8 October 2015, Mr  Farbenbloom accepted the appointment.</p>
