        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the European Communities. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 18 November 1997, the European Communities requested  consultations with the United States in respect of Sections 921-927 of the US  Internal Revenue Code and related measures, establishing special tax treatment  for &ldquo;Foreign Sales Corporations&rdquo; (FSC). The European Communities contended that  these provisions were inconsistent with the United States' obligations under  Articles&nbsp;III:4 and XVI of the GATT 1994, Articles 3.1(a) and (b) of the SCM  Agreement, and Articles 3 and 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 1 July 1998, the European Communities requested the  establishment of a panel. In the request for a panel, the European Communities invoked  Article 3.1(a) and (b) of the SCM Agreement, and Articles 3 and 8, 9 and 10 of  the Agreement on Agriculture, and did not pursue the claims under the GATT  1994. At its meeting on 23 July 1998, the DSB deferred the establishment of a  panel. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Further to a second request to establish a panel by the  European Communities, the DSB established a panel at its meeting on 22  September 1998. Barbados, Canada and Japan reserved their third-parties rights.  On 9 November 1998, the panel was composed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">
          On 8 October 1999, the panel report was circulated to  Members. The panel found that, through the FSC scheme, the United States had  acted inconsistently with its obligations under Article 3.1(a) of the SCM  Agreement as well as with its obligations under Article 3.3 of the Agreement on  Agriculture (and consequently with its obligations under Article 8 of that  Agreement).&nbsp; The panel recommended,  pursuant to Article&nbsp;4.7 of the SCM Agreement, that the DSB request the  United&nbsp;States to withdraw the FSC subsidies without delay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that this would require legislative  action, the panel accordingly specified that the FSC subsidies must be  withdrawn at the latest with effect from 1 October 2000.On 28 October 1999, the  United States notified the DSB of its decision to appeal certain issues of law  and legal interpretations developed by the panel. On 2&nbsp;November 1999, the  United&nbsp;States withdrew, for scheduling reasons, its notice of appeal  pursuant to Rule 30(1) of the Working Procedures for Appellate Review, stating  that the withdrawal was conditional on its right to file a new notice of appeal  pursuant to Rule 20 of the Working Procedures. On 26 November 1999, the United States  notified the DSB of its decision to appeal certain issues of law and legal  interpretations developed by the panel. On 24 February 2000, the Appellate Body  report was circulated to Members. The Appellate Body:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">upheld the panel&rsquo;s finding that the FSC measure  constituted a prohibited subsidy under Article 3.1(a) of the SCM  Agreement.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">reversed the panel&rsquo;s finding that the FSC  measure involved &ldquo;the provision of subsidies to reduce the costs of marketing  exports&rdquo; of agricultural products under Article 9.1(d) of the Agreement on  Agriculture and, in consequence, reversed the panel&rsquo;s findings that the United States  had acted inconsistently with its obligations under Article 3.3 of the  Agreement on Agriculture.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">found that the United States acted  inconsistently with its obligations under Articles 10.1 and 8 of the Agreement on  Agriculture by applying export subsidies, through the FSC measure, in a manner  which results in, or threatens to lead to, circumvention of its export subsidy  commitments with respect to agricultural products.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">also emphasized that it was not ruling that a Member  must choose one kind of tax system over another so as to be consistent with  that Member&rsquo;s WTO obligations. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 20 March 2000, the DSB adopted the  Appellate Body report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body  report.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Compliance proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 2 October 2000, the European Communities and the  United States informed the DSB of Agreed Procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of  the DSU and Article 4 of the SCM Agreement.&nbsp;  On 17&nbsp;November 2000, the European Communities requested  consultations under Article 21.5 of the DSU.&nbsp;  On 7 December 2000, the European Communities requested the establishment  of a compliance panel.. At its meeting on 20 December 2000, the DSB agreed to  refer the matter to the original panel. Australia, Canada, India, Jamaica and  Japan reserved their third party rights. On 5 January 2001, the compliance panel  was composed. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 20 August 2001, the compliance panel report was  circulated to the Members. The compliance panel concluded that the FSC Repeal  and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000 (the amended FSC legislation)  was still inconsistent with Articles 3.1(a) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement, with Articles  10.1 and 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture and with Article III:4 of the GATT 1994.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 15 October 2001, the United States notified the DSB  of its decision to appeal certain issues of law and legal interpretations  developed by the compliance panel report. On 14 January 2002, the Appellate  Body report was circulated to Members. The Appellate Body:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">upheld the compliance panel&rsquo;s findings that the  United States acted inconsistently with its obligations under the SCM  Agreement, the Agreement on Agriculture, and the GATT 1994 through the FSC  amended legislation, a measure taken by the United States to implement the  recommendations and rulings made by the DSB in the original proceedings in the US  &mdash; FSC dispute;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">with respect to third party rights, found that  the compliance panel erred in its interpretation of Article 10.3 of the DSU in  declining to rule that <strong>all </strong>written submissions of the parties filed  prior to the first meeting of the compliance panel must be provided to the  third parties. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 29 January 2002, the DSB adopted the  Appellate Body report and the compliance panel Report, as upheld by the  Appellate Body Report. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Proceedings under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 17 November 2000, the European Communities requested  authorization from the DSB to take appropriate countermeasures and to suspend  concessions pursuant to Article 4.10 of the SCM Agreement and Article 22.2 of  the DSU in the amount of USD&nbsp;4043 million per year.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 27 November 2000, the United States requested that  the matter be referred to arbitration pursuant to Article 22.6 of the DSU  alleging that the proposed countermeasures were not appropriate within the  meaning of Article 4.10 of the SCM Agreement and that the level of suspension  of concessions was not equivalent to the level of nullification or impairment  within the meaning of Article 22.7 of the DSU. &nbsp;At the DSB meeting on 28 November 2000, the  DSB agreed that the matter raised by the United States is referred to  arbitration as required by Article 22.6 of the DSU.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 21 December 2000, in accordance with paragraph 11 of  the Agreed Procedures, the United States and the European Communities requested  the Arbitrator to suspend the arbitration proceeding until adoption of the compliance  panel report or, if there is an appeal, adoption of the Appellate Body report.  The arbitration proceeding was accordingly suspended.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 29 January 2002, after the adoption of the  compliance reports (see above), the arbitration proceeding was automatically  reactivated.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 30 August 2002, the Decision of the Arbitrator was  circulated to Members. The Arbitrator determined that the suspension by the European  Communities of concessions under the GATT 1994 in the form of the imposition of  a 100 per cent <em>ad valorem</em> charge on imports of certain goods from the  United States in a maximum amount of USD&nbsp;4,043 million per year, as  described in the European Communities&rsquo; request for authorization to take  countermeasures and suspend concessions, would constitute appropriate  countermeasures within the meaning of Article 4.10 of the SCM Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 24 April 2003, the European Communities requested  authorization to suspend concessions or other obligations under Article 22.7 of  the DSU and Article 4.10 of the SCM Agreement. At its meeting on 7 May 2003,  the DSB granted the European Communities authorization to take appropriate  countermeasures and to suspend concessions.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Compliance proceedings (second recourse)</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 5 November 2004, the European Communities requested  consultations under Articles 4 and 21.5 of the DSU, Article 4 of the SCM Agreement, Article 19 of the  Agreement on Agriculture and Article&nbsp;XXII:1 of the GATT 1994 with respect  to the American JOBS Creation Act of 2004 (the &ldquo;JOBS Act&rdquo;) enacted by  the United States on 22 October 2004. According to the European Communities,  the JOBS Act was intended to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings in  this case (compliance phase) but failed to do so properly and was inconsistent  with the same provisions of the WTO&nbsp;Agreement  as did the predecessor legislation. In particular, the European Communities  considered that Section 101 of the JOBS Act contains transitional provisions  which will allow US exporters to continue to benefit from the WTO incompatible  FSC Replacement and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act (a) in the years 2005  and 2006 with respect to all export transactions and (b) for an indefinite  period with respect to certain binding contracts, thus failing to withdraw the  subsidy and implement the DSB&rsquo;s recommendations and rulings.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 17 November 2004, Australia requested to join the  consultations.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 13 January 2005, the European Communities requesting  the establishment of a compliance panel. At its meeting of 25 January 2005, the  DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 17 February 2005,  the DSB agreed to refer the matter to the original panel.&nbsp; Australia, Brazil and China reserved their  third party rights. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 22 April 2005, the European Communities requested  the Director-General to compose the compliance panel. On 2 May 2005, the  Director-General composed the compliance panel. On 2&nbsp;August 2005, the Chairman  of the compliance panel informed the DSB that given the particular  circumstances of this case and the schedule agreed after consultations with  parties to this dispute, it was&nbsp;not possible for the compliance panel to  complete its work within the 90-day period as foreseen in Article 21.5, and  that&nbsp;the compliance panel expected to complete its work by the second week  of August. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 30 September 2005, the second compliance panel  report was circulated to Members. The compliance panel found that the United  States has failed to implement fully the DSB recommendations and rulings  arising from the original dispute and first compliance proceedings. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 24 November 2005, the&nbsp;United States notified the  DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate&nbsp;Body certain issues of law covered  in the compliance panel report and certain legal interpretations developed by  the compliance panel. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 10 January 2006, the Appellate Body informed the DSB  that due to the time required for completion and translation of the report, the  Appellate Body would not be able to circulate its report within the 60-day  period, and that it&nbsp;estimated that the report would be circulated no later  than 13 February 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 13 February 2006, the Appellate Body report  was circulated to Members.&nbsp; The Appellate Body upheld the compliance  panel&rsquo;s findings. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 14 March 2006, the DSB adopted the  Appellate Body report and the compliance panel report, as upheld by the  Appellate Body report.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At  the DSB meeting on 17 May 2006, the United States reported that, on 11 May  2006, the US Congress had passed legislation to repeal the  &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; provisions of the American  Jobs Creation Act and the ETI Act that were a subject of the recent compliance proceedings. The United&nbsp;States  understood that the US President was expected to sign the legislation later in  the course of the day. With that development, the United States understood that  the United States and the European Communities would be able to put this  dispute behind them. The United States welcomed news of recent efforts by the European  Communities in response to the repeal and looked forward to hearing more from  the European Communities in the course of the day. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The  European Communities said that they warmly welcomed the repeal by Congress of  the &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. When the transition rules of that Act  were to expire at the end of the year, compliance would finally be achieved in  this very long saga. The European Communities affirmed that once the US  President signed the Bill, the sanctions would end.</p>
