         <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Tunisia</strong> (See also <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds555_e.htm">DS555</a>)</p>
        <p align="left">On 21 February 2019, Tunisia requested consultations  with Morocco concerning definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Morocco on  imports of school exercise books. This is the second consultations request  submitted by Tunisia against Morocco on a similar matter (see DS555, concerning <em>provisional</em> anti-dumping duties  imposed by Morocco on imports of school exercise books from Tunisia).</p>
        <p>Tunisia claimed that the challenged measures appear to  be inconsistent with:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Articles 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.1.1, 2.2.2,  2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.8, 5.10, 6.5, 6.5.1, 6.8, 9, 11,  12.2, 12.2.2, 18.1 and paragraphs 1, 3, 5, and 6 of Annex II of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement; and<br>
&nbsp;           </li>

        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p align="left">On 19 September 2019, Tunisia  requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 30&nbsp;September&nbsp;2019,  the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
        <p align="left">At  its meeting on 28 October 2019, the DSB established a panel. Brazil, Canada,  China, the European Union, Japan, Madagascar, the Russian Federation and the United States  reserved their third-party rights.</p>
        <p align="left">On 9  March 2020, Tunisia requested the Director-General to compose the panel. On 19  March 2020, the Director-General composed the panel.</p>
        <p align="left">On 17  November 2020, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that, due to the number  and complexity of the questions before the panel in this case, the panel intended  to issue its final report to the parties on the first half of 2021.</p>

    	    <p>This dispute, brought to the WTO in September 2019, concerns  a definitive anti-dumping measure imposed by Morocco on imports of school  exercise books from Tunisia following an investigation opened by the Ministry  of Industry, Investment, Trade and the Digital Economy (MIICEN) of Morocco in  May 2017.</p>
            <p><strong>Allegations by Tunisia concerning calculation of the  dumping margin </strong></p>
            <p>Tunisia contested firstly several aspects of the dumping  margin calculation used by the Moroccan investigating authority. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first of these concerned the construction  of the normal value established by MIICEN and, specifically, whether including  certain distribution costs in the normal value was compatible with Article 2.2 of  the Anti-Dumping Agreement. <br>
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>The second concerned the &ldquo;reasonable  amount of profit&rdquo; (within the meaning of Article 2.2) and, notably,  whether MIICEN could exclude certain domestic sales of exercise books from this  amount, on the grounds that those models were not exported. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>On these two issues, the Panel agreed with Tunisia by considering  that the construction of the normal value used by MIICEN was incompatible with  Article 2.2 and that the amount attributed to profits was incompatible with  Articles 2.2 and 2.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </p>
            <p>Secondly, Tunisia contested the &ldquo;fair&rdquo; comparison  between the normal value and the export price of the exercise books. There  again Tunisia contested two aspects of the dumping margin calculation used by MIICEN: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first aspect concerned the  mathematical formula used by the investigating authority to calculate the dumping  margin (and specifically the choice of the numerator and the denominator). <br>
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>The second concerned MIICEN's refusal to  make any allowances for the physical characteristics of certain exercise books  sold under licence. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Panel agreed with Tunisia on the first issue by finding  that the mathematical formula used for calculating the dumping margin neither allowed  for a dumping margin to be expressed nor reflected the dumping margin of each  of the Tunisian exporters that had taken part in the investigation. In the  Panel's view, that error led to an unfair comparison between the normal value  and the export price of the exercise books and thus ran counter to Article 2.4 of  the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </p>
            <p>As to the request to make allowances by the Tunisian  exporters on the grounds that certain models of the exercise books were sold  under licence, the Panel considered that the exporters had not demonstrated how  such a difference affected the comparability between the normal value and the  export price of the exercise books. The Panel did, however, find that MIICEN  did not elaborate in its final determination on &ldquo;the  reasons for the acceptance or rejection of relevant arguments or claims made by  the exporters&rdquo; concerning the impact of licences on the  comparability of the prices, in violation of Article 12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement. </p>
            <p><strong>Allegations by Tunisia concerning determination of injury  and the causal link between imports and injury</strong></p>
            <p>Tunisia requested that the Panel find that determination of  injury caused to the domestic industry was incompatible with Articles 3.1, 3.2 and  3.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </p>
            <p> Regarding the impact of imports on prices, the Panel  considered that Morocco had acted in a manner that was incompatible with  Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement by not carrying out an  &ldquo;objective examination&rdquo; of price undercutting, price depression and  prevention of price increases. Furthermore, the Panel considered that Article  3.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement did not allow the investigating authority to  compare the price of Tunisian imports with a hypothetical price of the domestic  product in order to examine the existence of price undercutting. In the Panel's  view, the fact that MIICEN had applied this method was incompatible with Article  3.2. Lastly, the Panel also found that MIICEN had not carried out an &ldquo;objective  examination&rdquo; of evolution in sales, market share and productivity of the  domestic market, as well as profitability within the meaning of Articles 3.1 and  3.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.</p>
            <p>Regarding determination of a causal link, Tunisia requested that  the Panel find that an injury analysis incompatible with Articles 3.1, 3.2 and  3.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement could not lead to a proper causation analysis.  The Panel found in favour of Tunisia on this issue and found the causation  analysis conducted by Morocco to be incompatible with Articles 3.1 and 3.5 of  the Anti-Dumping Agreement </p>
            <p>Lastly, Tunisia requested that the Panel find that MIICEN was  bound to examine the competition of Imprimerie Moderne as a &ldquo;known factor&rdquo;  causing injury to the domestic industry. The Panel found that the evidence  before the investigating authority did not demonstrate that the competition of Imprimerie  Moderne was a cause of injury and that Morocco had therefore not violated Articles  3.1 and 3.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </p>
            <p><strong>Allegations by Tunisia concerning MIICEN's examination of  the application made by domestic producers</strong></p>
            <p>Tunisia alleged that the investigating authority had not  properly examined the evidence of dumping contained in the application made by  domestic producers and that the decision to initiate an investigation was  therefore incompatible with Articles 5.2, 5.3 and 5.8 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement. </p>
            <p>The Panel found that while Article 5.2 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement set forth what the application should contain, it did not impose any  direct obligation on the investigating authority. It considered, however, that  the investigating authority was bound, by virtue of Article 5.3, to examine the  accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the application to determine  whether there was sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of an  investigation. The Panel subsequently found that MIICEN had not duly examined  the evidence related to the export price, the normal value and certain adjustments.  It therefore found that Morocco had violated Article 5.3 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement.</p>

    <p class="paranormaltext">On 28  July 2021, Morocco  notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues  of law and legal interpretations in the panel report.  On 16 August 2021, Tunisia requested the Chair of  the DSB to circulate a communication noting that Morocco  had not served an appellant's submission. Consequently, Tunisia  confirmed that it was not in a position to exercise its right to serve an  appellee's submission within the required  time frame  given that Tunisia did not know which specific arguments  Morocco intended to raise. </p>
