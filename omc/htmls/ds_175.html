		<h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the European Communities. </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 6 October 1998, the EC requested consultations with
      India concerning certain measures affecting the automotive sector being
      applied by India. The EC stated that the measures include the documents
      entitled “Export and Import Policy, 1997-2002”, “ITC (HS
      Classification) Export and Import Policy 1997-2002”
      (“Classification”), and “Public Notice No. 60 (PN/97-02) of
      12 December 1997, Export and Import Policy April 1997-March 2002”,
      and any other legislative or administrative provision implemented or
      consolidated by these policies, as well as MoUs signed by the Indian
      Government with certain manufacturers of automobiles. The EC contended
      that:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>under these measures, imports of complete automobiles
      and of certain parts and components were subject to a system of
      non-automatic import licenses.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>in accordance with Public Notice No. 60, import
      licenses might be granted only to local joint venture manufacturers that
      had signed an MoU with the Indian Government, whereby they undertook, <i>inter
      alia</i>, to comply with certain local content and export balancing
      requirements.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>The EC alleged violations of Articles III and XI of
      GATT 1994, and Article 2 of the TRIMs Agreement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 1 May 1999, the United States requested
      consultations (WT/DS175) with India in respect of certain Indian measures
      affecting trade and investment in the motor vehicle sector. The United
      States contended that the measures in question required manufacturing
      firms in the motor vehicle sector to:</p>
      <ol class="paranormaltext" type="i">
        <li>achieve specified levels of local content;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>achieve a neutralization of foreign exchange by
      balancing the value of certain imports with the value of exports of cars
      and components over a stated period; and<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>limit imports to a value based on the previous year’s exports.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="paranormaltext">According to the United States, these measures were
      enforceable under Indian law and rulings, and manufacturing firms in the
      motor vehicle sector must comply with these requirements in order to
      obtain Indian import licenses for certain motor vehicle parts and
      components. The United States considered that these measures violate the
      obligations of India under Articles III and XI of GATT 1994, and Article 2
      of the TRIMS Agreement.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 15 May 2000, the US requested the establishment of a
      panel. At its meeting on 19 June 2000, the DSB deferred the establishment
      of a Panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Further to a second request to establish a panel by the US,
        the DSB established a panel at its meeting on 27 July 2000. The EC, Japan
        and Korea reserved their third-party rights.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 12 October 2000, the EC also requested the
      establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 23 October 2000, the DSB
      deferred the establishment of a Panel. Further to a second request by the
      EC, the DSB established a panel at its meeting of 17 November 2000. Since
      a panel had already been established with a similar mandate in the
      framework of the above-mentioned case WT/DS175, the DSB decided to join
      the panel with the already established panel in that case pursuant to
      Article 9.1 of the DSU. Japan reserved its third-party rights. On 14
      November 2000, the US requested the Director-General to determine the
      composition of the Panel. On 24 November 2000, the Panel was composed.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 21 December 2001, the Panel circulated its report to
      the Members. The Panel concluded that:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>India had acted inconsistently with its obligations
      under Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 by imposing on automotive
      manufacturers an obligation to use a certain proportion of local parts and
      components in the manufacture of cars and automotive vehicles (“indigenization”
      condition);<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>India had acted inconsistently with its obligations
      under Article XI of the GATT 1994 by imposing on automotive manufacturers
      an obligation to balance any importation of certain kits and components
      with exports of equivalent value (“trade balancing” condition);
      and,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>India had acted inconsistently with its obligations
          under Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 by imposing, in the context of the
          trade balancing condition, an obligation to offset the amount of any
          purchases of previously imported restricted kits and components on the
          Indian market, by exports of equivalent value.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">The Panel recommended that the DSB requests India to
        bring its measures into conformity with its obligations under the WTO
      Agreements.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 31 January 2002, India appealed the above Panel
      Report. In particular, India sought review of the following Panel’s
      conclusion on the grounds that they are in error and based upon erroneous
      findings on issues of law and related legal instruments:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>Articles 11 and 19.1 of the DSU required it to address
      the question of whether the measures found to be inconsistent with
      Articles III:4 and XI:1 of the GATT had been brought into conformity with
      the GATT as a result of measures taken by India during the course of the
      proceedings, and<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the enforcement of the export obligations that
      automobile manufacturers incurred until 1 April 2001 under India’s former
      import licensing scheme is inconsistent with Articles III:4 and XI:1 of
      the GATT.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 14 March 2002, India withdrew its appeal. Further to
      India’s
      withdrawal of its appeal, the Appellate Body issued a short Report
      outlining the procedural history of the case. At the DSB meeting on 5
      April 2002, the US commended India’s decision to withdraw its appeal and
      shared some of India’s reservations with regard to Section VIII of the
      Panel Report. The EC considered that the Panel’s findings were justified.
      Despite its decision to withdraw its appeal as a result of the
      introduction of its new auto policy, India indicated that the findings
      contained in Section VIII were outside of the Panel’s terms of reference
      and were both factually and legally incorrect. India requested that the
      DSB adopt only a part of the Panel Report and consider the adoption of
      Section VIII only at its next meeting. The EC responded that the Reports
      should be adopted unconditionally by the parties, thus there was no
      justification for India’s request. The DSB proceeded with the adoption in
      full of the Appellate Body and Panel reports.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Implementation  of adopted reports</h3>
	  <p class="paranormaltext">On 2 May 2002, India informed the DSB that it would
		  need a reasonable period of time to implement the recommendations and
		  rulings of the DSB and that it was ready to enter into discussions with
	  the EC and the US in this regard.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 18 July 2002, the parties informed the DSB that they
      had mutually agreed that the reasonable period of time to implement the
      recommendations and rulings of the DSB, shall be five months, that is from
      5 April 2002 to 5 September 2002.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 6 November 2002, India informed the DSB that it had fully complied
      with the recommendations of the DSB in this dispute by issuing Public
      Notice No. 31 on 19 August 2002 terminating the trade balancing
      requirement. India also informed that earlier it had removed the
      indigenization requirement vide Public Notice No. 30 on 4 September 2001.</p></div>
