        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Chinese Taipei.&nbsp; (See <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds375_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS375</a> and <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds376_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS376</a>) </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 12 June 2008, Chinese Taipei requested consultations  with the European Communities and its member States  with respect to their tariff treatment of certain information technology  products. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Chinese Taipei claimed that the tariff treatment the  European Communities and its member States accord to certain information  technology products does not respect their commitments to provide duty-free  treatment for these products under the Information Technology Agreement  (ITA).&nbsp; According to Chinese Taipei,&nbsp;the European Communities and its  member States now impose duties on these  products contrary to their scheduled duty-free tariff concessions arising from  the ITA. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Chinese Taipei asserted that a number of EC customs  classification legal instruments, alone or in combination with Council  Regulation (EEC) No. 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical  nomenclature and on the&nbsp;Common Customs Tariff, including all annexes  thereto, as amended, appear to be inconsistent with the EC's and its member  States' obligations under Article II:1(a) and II:1(b) of the GATT 1994 and  their Schedules, and therefore nullify or impair benefits accruing to Chinese  Taipei under the GATT 1994. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Chinese Taipei also claimed that the publication of  certain amended explanatory notes in the EC Official Journal after their  application by its member States is inconsistent with the EC's obligations  under Article X:1 and X:2 of the GATT 1994. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The United    States, China and Japan requested  to join the consultations.&nbsp; Subsequently, the European Communities  informed the DSB that it had accepted the request of China to join the consultations. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 18   August 2008, the United    States, Japan and Chinese Taipei, jointly  and severally, requested the establishment of a panel.&nbsp; At its meeting on 29 August 2008, the DSB  deferred the establishment of a panel.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 23 September 2008, the DSB  established a panel. Brazil;&nbsp; China;&nbsp; Hong Kong, China;&nbsp; India;  &nbsp;Korea; the Philippines; &nbsp;Thailand and Viet Nam reserved their  third-party rights. Subsequently, Australia, Costa Rica, Singapore and Turkey reserved  their third-party rights.&nbsp; On 12&nbsp;January 2009, the United  States, Japan and Chinese Taipei requested the Director-General to compose the  panel.&nbsp; On 22 January 2009, the Director-General composed  the panel.&nbsp; On 23 January 2009, the United States  and Japan  reserved their third party rights. &nbsp;On 21 July 2009, the Chairman  of the panel informed the DSB that due to the complexity of the matter and the  fact that the proceedings involve three complainants, the panel would not be  able to complete its work within six&nbsp;months from the date of the panel's  composition.&nbsp; The panel estimated that it  would issue its final report to the parties in December 2009.&nbsp; On 21 December 2009, the Chairman of the panel informed the  DSB that it expected to issue its final report to parties by the end of April  2010.&nbsp; On 29 April 2010, the Chairman of the panel  informed the DSB that it now expected to issue its final report to the parties  by early July 2010.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 16   August 2010, the panel reports were circulated to Members.&nbsp; The panel concluded as follows:</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> <strong>FPDs (Flat-Panel Display Devices)</strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">
          Concerning certain EC measures that resulted in  dutiable tariff treatment of certain flat-panel display devices (FPDs), the  panel concluded, with respect to the CNEN 2008/C 133/01 (which operates in  conjunction with the CN), item 4 in the Annex to Commission Regulation No.  634/2005 as well as items 2, 3 and 4 in the Annex to Commission Regulation No.  2171/2005, that: </p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">In the absence of the duty suspension under  Council Regulation No. 179/2009, the measures direct national customs  authorities to classify some flat panel display devices that are capable of  receiving and reproducing video images both from an automatic data-processing  machine and from a source other than an automatic  data-processing machine, that fall within the scope of the FPDs narrative  description and/or within the scope of the CN code 8471 60 90, under dutiable  headings.&nbsp; Because the concessions call  for duty-free treatment of products falling within their scope, this dutiable  treatment is inconsistent with Article II:1(b) of the GATT 1994.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">In the absence of the duty suspension under  Council Regulation No. 179/2009, the measures direct national customs authorities to classify some flat  panel display devices that have a DVI interface, whether or not they are  capable of receiving signals from another source, that fall within the scope of  the FPDs narrative description and/or within the scope of the CN code 8471 60  90, under dutiable headings.&nbsp; Because the  concessions call for duty-free treatment of products falling within their  scope, this dutiable treatment is inconsistent with Article II:1(b) of the GATT  1994.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">Given the duty suspension currently in effect  for certain products in dispute falling within the scope of the FPDs narrative  description or within the scope of CN code 8471 60 90, the inconsistency with  Article II:1(b) referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above is eliminated  because the duties are suspended and hence are not in excess of those provided  for in the EC Schedule.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">For those products in dispute falling within the  scope of the FPDs narrative description or within the scope of CN code 8471 60 90 and that are not covered by the  duty suspension with the result that they are subject to dutiable treatment,  the duty suspension does not eliminate the inconsistency with Article II:1(b)  for these products and therefore this dutiable treatment is inconsistent with  Article II:1(b) of the GATT 1994.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The European Communities fails to accord treatment no  less favourable than that set forth in its Schedule to the commerce of the  other WTO Members, in particular certain flat panel display devices that are  capable of receiving and reproducing video images both from an automatic  data-processing machine and from a source other than an automatic  data-processing machine, or that have a DVI interface, whether or not they are  capable of receiving signals from another source.&nbsp; Thus, the European Communities is  inconsistent with Article II:1(a) of the GATT 1994.&nbsp; This inconsistency is not eliminated by the  duty suspension with respect to certain products in dispute falling within the  scope of the FPDs narrative description or within the scope of CN code 8471 60  90 because the duty suspension measure does not eliminate the failure to accord  treatment no less favourable to the commerce of the other WTO Members.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> <strong>STBCs (set-top boxes which have a communication  function)</strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">
          Concerning certain EC measures that resulted in  dutiable tariff treatment of certain set-top boxes which have a communication  function (STBCs), the panel concluded that:</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> With respect to the CNEN 2008/C 112/03 which operates  in conjunction with the CN, that:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">The measures direct national customs authorities  to classify under dutiable headings some set top boxes which incorporate a  device performing a recording or reproducing function and retain the essential  character of a set top box and that fall within the scope of the STBCs  narrative description in the Annex to the EC Schedule.&nbsp; Because the concession calls for duty-free  treatment of products falling within its scope, this dutiable treatment is  inconsistent with Article II:1(b) of the GATT 1994.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">The measures direct national customs authorities  to classify under dutiable headings some set top boxes which utilise ISDN, WLAN  or Ethernet technology, and that fall within the scope of the STBCs narrative  description in the Annex to the EC Schedule.&nbsp;  Because the concession calls for duty-free treatment of products falling  within its scope, this dutiable treatment is inconsistent with Article II:1(b)  of the GATT 1994.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">By virtue of the inconsistency with Article  II:1(b) of the GATT 1994, the measures accord treatment less favourable to such  set top boxes than that provided for under the STBCs narrative description in  the Annex to the EC Schedule and thus the measures are also inconsistent with  Article II:1(a) of the GATT 1994.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">Concerning certain claims on the consistency of the  CNEN 2008/C 112/03 with Article X of the GATT 1994, the Panel concluded that:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">The European Communities failed to publish  promptly CNEN 2008/C 112/03, such as to enable governments and traders to  become acquainted with them, and has thus acted inconsistently with Article X:1  of the GATT 1994.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">The European Communities has <em>not</em> acted inconsistently with Article  X:2 of the GATT 1994 with respect to the October 2006 CNEN amendment because  the complainants did not establish that the European Communities enforced the  October 2006 CNEN amendment before its official publication as CNEN 2008/C  112/03 in the EU Official Journal on 7 May 2008.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">The European Communities has acted  inconsistently with Article X:2 of the GATT 1994 with respect to the April 2007  CNEN amendment by enforcing the April 2007 CNEN amendment before its official  publication as CNEN 2008/C 112/03 in the EU Official Journal on 7 May 2008.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>MFMs (Multifunctional Digital Machines)</strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">
          Concerning certain EC measures that resulted in  dutiable tariff treatment of certain MFMs, the panel concluded, with respect to  item 1of the Annex to Commission Regulation No. 517/1999, that:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">The regulation requires dutiable treatment of  certain ADP MFMs that fall within the scope of the concession for &ldquo;input  or output units&rdquo; in HS1996 subheading 8471 60 of the EC Schedule.&nbsp; Because the concession calls for duty-free  treatment of products falling within its scope, this dutiable treatment is  inconsistent with Article II:1(b) of the GATT 1994.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">By virtue of the inconsistency with Article  II:1(b) of the GATT 1994, the measures accord treatment less favourable to  certain ADP MFMs than that provided for under the EC Schedule and thus the measures  are also inconsistent with Article II:1(a) of the GATT 1994.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">The regulation requires dutiable treatment of  certain non-ADP MFMs that fall within the scope of the concession for  &ldquo;facsimile machines&rdquo; in HS1996 subheading 8517 21 of the EC  Schedule.&nbsp; Because the concession calls  for duty-free treatment of products falling within its scope, this dutiable  treatment is inconsistent with Article II:1(b) of the GATT 1994.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">By virtue of the inconsistency with Article  II:1(b) of the GATT 1994, the measures accord treatment less favourable to  certain non-ADP MFMs than that provided for under the EC Schedule and thus the  measures are also inconsistent with Article II:1(a) of the GATT 1994.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">With respect to the 2005 Statement, that:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">Because the measure has guided and serves to  guide the European Communities uniform application of the common customs tariff  in a way that results in the application of duties to those ADP MFMs that fall  within the duty-free concession, the measure is inconsistent with Article  II:1(b) of the GATT 1994.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">By virtue of the inconsistency with Article  II:1(b) of the GATT 1994, the measures accord treatment less favourable to  certain ADP MFMs than that provided for under the EC Schedule and thus the  measures are also inconsistent with Article II:1(a) of the GATT 1994.<br />

          <li class="paranormaltext">The regulation does not require the dutiable  treatment of non-ADP MFMs with a facsimile function.&nbsp; Therefore, the European Communities has <em>not</em> acted inconsistently with Article  II:1(b) of the GATT 1994 with respect to non-ADP MFMs with a facsimile function  as the measure does not impose duties in excess of those provided for in the EC  Schedule.&nbsp; </li>

        <p class="paranormaltext">In conclusion, the panel found that to the extent that  the European Communities has acted inconsistently with Articles II:1(a),  II:1(b), X:1 and X:2 of the GATT&nbsp;1994, it has nullified or impaired  benefits accruing to Chinese Taipei under that Agreement. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The panel recommended that the DSB request the European  Communities to bring the relevant measures into conformity with its obligations  under the GATT 1994.&nbsp; In doing so, the  panel recalled that the European Communities had indicated that the Commission  Regulation Nos. 634/2005 and 2171/2005 would be repealed.&nbsp; It further recalled that the European  Communities had indicated that Commission Regulation Nos. 517/1999 and 400/2006  would be repealed as of October 2009.&nbsp;  The panel stated that, however, since there was no evidence properly  before it confirming such repeal, it proceeded on the basis that the said  measures were still in force.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 21 September 2010, the DSB adopted the panel  reports.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 25 October 2010, the European Union informed  the DSB that it intended to implement the recommendations and rulings of the  DSB and that it would need a reasonable period of time to do so.&nbsp; On 20 December 2010, Chinese Taipei and the European Union  informed the DSB that they had agreed that the reasonable period of time for  the European Union to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB  shall be nine months and nine days from the date of the adoption of the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB.&nbsp;  Accordingly, the reasonable period of time expired on 30 June 2011.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 6 July 2011, the European Union and Chinese Taipei  notified the DSB of Agreed Procedures under Articles&nbsp;21 and 22 of the  DSU.&nbsp; At the DSB meeting on 20 July 2011,  the European Union said that, in June 2011, it had adopted measures necessary  to comply with the DSB's recommendations and rulings.&nbsp; The adopted measures ensured the full and  timely implementation of the DSB's recommendations and rulings.&nbsp; <strong>Chinese Taipei</strong> said that it was  concerned about some ambiguity and lack of clarity with the measures adopted by  the European Union.&nbsp; Chinese Taipei had  thus reached a sequencing agreement with the European Union.&nbsp; </p>
