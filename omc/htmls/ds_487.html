        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the European Union. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 19 December 2014, the European Union requested  consultations with the United States with respect to conditional tax incentives  established by the State of Washington in relation to the development, manufacture,  and sale of large civil aircraft.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The European Union alleges that the measures constitute  specific subsidies within the meaning of Articles 1 and 2 of the SCM Agreement.  The European Union also considers that the measures are prohibited subsidies  that are inconsistent with Articles 3.1(b) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement.</p>

        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 12 February 2015, the European Union requested  the establishment of a panel. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 23 February  2015, the  DSB established a panel. Brazil, China,  India, Japan, Korea and the Russian Federation reserved  their third-party rights. Subsequently, Australia and Canada  reserved their third-party rights.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 13 April 2015, the European Union requested the  Director-General to compose the panel. On 22&nbsp;April&nbsp;2015, the  Director-General composed the panel. On 29 September 2015, the Chair of  the panel informed the DSB that it estimated to issue its report within 12  months. On 23 September 2016, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB  that the final report was to be circulated to all Members by the end of November  2016.</p>

    	<p>This  dispute concerns legislation enacted in the state of Washington in the United  States in November 2013 through Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5952 (ESSB  5952), which amended and extended various tax incentives for the aerospace  industry. The European Union identified seven separate tax incentives,  including a reduced business and occupation tax rate, credits against business  taxation, and exemptions from various other taxes in the state of Washington.</p>
        <p>The  European Union claimed that those tax incentives are prohibited under  Articles&nbsp;3.1(b) and&nbsp;3.2 of the SCM  Agreement as subsidies that are contingent on the use of domestic over imported  goods. According to the European Union, the contingency results from two siting  provisions contained in ESSB 5952, namely a First Siting Provision and a Second  Siting Provision. In the European Union's view, the challenged aerospace tax  measures are <em>de&nbsp;jure</em> contingent  upon the use of domestic over imported goods inasmuch as the text of the  relevant legislation sets out the prohibited contingency. The  European&nbsp;Union also made a secondary claim that the aerospace tax measures  are <em>de&nbsp;facto</em> contingent upon the  use of domestic over imported goods.</p>
        <p>The  Panel found that, under each of the aerospace tax measures at issue, there is a  financial contribution by the Washington State government and a benefit is  thereby conferred. The Panel concluded therefore that each of the aerospace tax  measures at issue constitutes a subsidy within the meaning of Article 1 of the  SCM Agreement.</p>
        <p>With respect to the European Union's <em>de jure</em> claim against the aerospace tax  measures at issue, the Panel looked separately at the First Siting Provision  and the Second Siting Provision contained in ESSB 5952, to assess whether the  European Union had successfully demonstrated the existence of the prohibited  contingency in either of the provisions. In this regard, the Panel concluded  that the European Union had not demonstrated that, on their own, and based on  their express terms, the First Siting  Provision or the Second Siting  Provision make the challenged aerospace tax measures <em>de jure</em> contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods.</p>
        <p>The Panel  subsequently considered the two siting provisions acting jointly and concluded  that the European Union had not demonstrated that, acting together, the First Siting Provision and the Second Siting Provision make the challenged aerospace tax  measures <em>de jure </em>contingent upon the  use of domestic over imported goods.</p>
        <p>With  respect to the European Union's <em>de&nbsp;facto</em> claim against the aerospace tax measures at issue, the Panel considered the  joint operation of the First Siting Provision and the Second Siting Provision  contained in ESSB 5952, to assess whether the European Union had successfully  demonstrated the existence of the prohibited contingency. The Panel concluded  that the siting provisions in ESSB&nbsp;5952, and in particular the prospective  modalities of operation of Washington State Department of Revenue's discretion  under the Second Siting Provision, make one of the  challenged aerospace tax measures (namely, the reduced business and occupation  tax rate for the manufacturing or sale of commercial airplanes under  the  777X programme) <em>de facto</em> contingent  upon the use of domestic over imported goods within the meaning of  Article&nbsp;3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement.</p>
        <p>Having  found that the reduced business and occupation tax rate for the manufacturing or sale of commercial airplanes under the  777X programme is inconsistent with Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement,  the Panel also found that the United States has acted inconsistently with  Article 3.2 of the SCM Agreement.</p>
          </div>

 <p class="paranormaltext">On 16 December 2016, the United States notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law and legal interpretations in the panel report. On 17 January 2017, the European Union notified the DSB of its decision to cross-appeal.</p>
 <p class="paranormaltext">On 3 March 2017, after the expiry of the 30-day period provided for in Article 4.9 of the SCM Agreement, the Appellate Body informed the DSB that it would not be able to circulate the Appellate Body report in this appeal by the end of the 30-day period, or within the 60 day timeframe provided for in  Article 4.9 of the SCM Agreement. The Appellate Body referred to the scheduling of parallel appeals, shortage of staff in the Appellate Body Secretariat, and to particular aspects arising in this proceeding, including the time needed for adopting and complying with additional procedures to protect business confidential information, the consequent extensions of the deadlines for filing submissions, and overlapping issues identified by the participants in parallel proceedings. The Appellate Body also informed the DSB that the circulation date of the Appellate Body report in this appeal would be communicated to the participants and third participants in due course. On 31 August 2017,  the Appellate Body informed the DSB that its report in this appeal would be  circulated on 4 September 2017.</p>

    	    <p>The United States appealed the Panel's finding  that, with respect to the First and Second Siting Provisions, considered  jointly, the business and occupation (B&amp;O) aerospace tax rate is a subsidy <em>de&nbsp;facto</em> contingent upon the use of  domestic over imported goods under Article 3.1(b) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. For  its part, the European Union appealed the Panel's findings that the  European&nbsp;Union did not demonstrate that the First and Second Siting  Provisions, considered separately or jointly, make the United&nbsp;States'  aerospace tax measures <em>de&nbsp;jure</em> contingent, or that the First Siting Provision makes such measures <em>de&nbsp;facto</em> contingent, upon the use  of domestic over imported goods under Article&nbsp;3.1(b) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. </p>
    	    <p> In addressing  the European Union's interpretation claims, the Appellate Body ruled that the  Panel, in its <em>de&nbsp;jure</em> contingency analyses of the  First and Second Siting Provisions, did not articulate a legal standard under  Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement requiring the use of domestic goods to the  complete exclusion of imported goods. Neither did the Panel articulate such a  legal standard in assessing the <em>de&nbsp;facto </em>contingency of the First Siting Provision. The Appellate&nbsp;Body  therefore rejected the European Union's claims that the Panel erred in its  interpretation of Article&nbsp;3.1(b) in the context of its <em>de&nbsp;jure</em> contingency analyses of the  First and Second Siting Provisions, as well as its <em>de&nbsp;facto </em>contingency analysis of the First Siting Provision. </p>
    	    <p> The Appellate Body rejected the European&nbsp;Union's  claim that the Panel erred in its application of Article&nbsp;3.1(b) of the SCM  Agreement in finding that the First Siting Provision does not make the  aerospace tax measures <em>de&nbsp;jure</em> contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods. The Appellate Body  also rejected the European Union's claim that the Panel erred in its  application of Article&nbsp;3.1(b) by unduly restricting the scope of the  evidence from which it assessed <em>de&nbsp;jure </em>contingency with respect to the Second Siting Provision. In addition, the  Appellate&nbsp;Body did not consider that the Panel committed error under  Article 11 of the DSU in setting out the scope of application of the Second  Siting Provision. </p>
    	    <p> In addressing the appeal by the United States,  the Appellate Body considered that the Panel did not properly establish that  the Second Siting Provision entails a <em>de  facto</em> condition requiring the use of domestic over imported goods. The  Appellate Body did not consider that the Panel's analysis and reasoning  provided a sufficient basis for its finding that the Second Siting Provision  makes the B&amp;O aerospace tax rate <em>de&nbsp;facto</em> contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods. Therefore, the Appellate Body reversed the Panel's finding that the  B&amp;O aerospace tax rate is a prohibited subsidy under Article&nbsp;3.1(b)  of the SCM Agreement. </p>
    	    <p> Having reversed  the Panel's sole finding of inconsistency under Article 3.1(b) of the  SCM&nbsp;Agreement, the Appellate&nbsp;Body made no recommendation in this  dispute.</p>
