        <p align="left">On 4 April 2018, China requested  consultations with the United States concerning certain tariff measures on  Chinese goods which would allegedly be implemented through Section 301-310 of  the US Trade Act of 1974.</p>
        <p align="left"> China claimed that the measures appear  to be inconsistent with:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Articles I:1 and II:1 (a) and  (b) of the GATT 1994; and <br>&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Article 23 of the DSU.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 13 April 2018, the United States requested the  Chair of the DSB to circulate to Members a communication where it indicated  that the United States was willing to enter into consultations with China,  without prejudice to the US view that China's letter of 4 April 2018 did not  satisfy the requirements of Article 4 of the DSU. On 25  April 2018, China requested the Chair of the DSB to circulate to Members a  communication responding to the United States' communication of 13&nbsp;April  2018. While disagreeing with the US view that China's letter of 4 April 2018  did not satisfy the requirements of Article 4 of the DSU, China  indicated its  willingness to schedule a mutually convenient date for consultations within the  scope of  China's request.</p>
        <p>On 6 July 2018, China requested additional consultations that supplemented its consultations request of 4 April 2018. China  referred to the publication by the  United States on 15 June 2018 of a list of products of Chinese origin to be  subject to an <em>ad </em> <em>valorem</em> duty of 25% imposed  by the United States on the importation of certain Chinese products, since 6  July 2018. China maintained  that these duties were only applied to China's products and in excess of the  United States' bound rates.</p>
        <p>On 16 July 2018, the United States  requested the Chair of the DSB to circulate to Members a communication  referring to China's 6 July 2018 supplement to its consultations request of 4  April 2018. The United States also referred to certain  additional duties imposed by China on the importation of certain products from  the United States.</p>
        <p align="left">On 16 July 2018, China requested  additional consultations that supplemented its original consultations request of 4 April  2018  as well as its supplemental  request of 6 July 2018.  China referred to the publication  by the United States on 10 July 2018 of a list of products of Chinese origin to  be subject to an  &nbsp;<em>ad  valorem</em> duty of  10% to be imposed by the United States on the importation of  certain Chinese products . China  maintained that these duties were only to be applied to China's products and in  excess of the United States' bound rates.        </p>
        <p>On 26 July 2018,  the United States requested the Chair of the DSB to circulate to Members a  communication referring to China's 16 July 2018 supplement to its consultations  request. The United States indicated that the United  States was willing to enter into consultations with China, without prejudice to  the US view that China's letter of 4 April 2018 did not satisfy the  requirements of Article 4 of the DSU. The United States  also referred to certain additional duties that China announced it would impose  on the importation of certain products from the United States.</p>
        <p>On 18 September 2018, China requested  additional consultations that supplemented its original consultations request  of 4 April 2018 as well as its supplemental requests of 6 July 2018 and of 16  July 2018. On this occasion, China referred to the publication by the United  States on 17 September 2018 of a list of products of Chinese origin to be subject to an <em>ad valorem</em> duty of 10% from 24 September  2018 and of 25% from 1 January 2019. China maintained that these duties were only  to be applied to China's products and in excess of the United States' bound  rates.</p>
        <p>On 28 September 2018, the United States  requested the Chair of the DSB to circulate to Members a communication  referring to China's 18 September 2018 supplemental consultations request. The United States indicated that it was willing to enter  into consultations with China, and referred to certain additional duties on the  importation of products from the United States that China had announced on 18  September 2018.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p>On 6 December 2018, China  requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting  on 18 December 2018, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
        <p>At its meeting on 28 January 2019, the  DSB established a panel. Brazil, Canada, the European Union, India, Indonesia,  Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, the Russian Federation,  Singapore, Chinese Taipei and Ukraine reserved their third-party rights.</p>
        <p>On 24 May 2019, China requested the Director-General  to compose the panel. On 3 June 2019, the Director-General composed the panel. Following the resignation of a panelist  on 25 September 2019, and further to a request from China, the Director-General  on 17 October 2019 appointed a new panelist.</p>
        <p>On  9 April 2020, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that based on the  timetable agreed between the parties and the panel, the panel expected to issue  its final report to the parties by the end of June 2020. The Chair apprised the DSB that the report would be available to the public  once it was circulated to the Members in all three official languages, and that  the date of circulation depends on completion of translation.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="bkmk543r" name="bkmk543r"></a>On 15 September 2020, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

    	    <p align="left">This dispute  concerns China's challenge to the additional duties that the United States  imposed on certain products from China. The United States imposed these  additional duties pursuant to the findings of a Section 301 Report addressing  China's practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and  innovation, which the United States considers to be unfair and distortive policies of &ldquo;state-sanctioned theft&rdquo;, misappropriation of US technology,  intellectual property, and commercial secrets.</p>
            <p align="left">Before  the Panel, China challenged:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the 25% additional duties imposed in June 2018 on a  first set of products with an approximate annual trade value of USD 34 billion  (List 1); and </li>
              <li>the additional duties on a second set of products  with an approximate annual trade value of USD 200 billion (List 2), initially imposed  in September 2018 at 10% and subsequently raised in May 2019 to 25%.</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left">China  claimed that these additional duties were inconsistent with Articles I:1 and  II:1(a) and (b) of the GATT 1994.</p>
            <p align="left">The  United States raised two main sets of arguments in response: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>that by engaging in bilateral negotiations to  address several trade concerns &mdash; including some matters covered by this dispute  &mdash; &nbsp;the parties had decided to settle  their dispute outside the WTO, and thus reached a &ldquo;settlement of the  matter&rdquo; within the meaning of the third sentence of Article 12.7 of the  DSU; for that reason the Panel should confine its report to a brief statement  of the facts and a notation that a settlement has been reached; and </li>
              <li>that, in any event, the additional duties were  justified under Article XX(a) of the GATT 1994, as measures necessary to  protect US public morals. The United States argued that &nbsp;&nbsp;China's acts, policies, and practices  addressed in the relevant Section 301 Report amounted to &ldquo;state-sanctioned  theft&rdquo; and misappropriation of US technology, intellectual property, and  commercial secrets, and this violated the public morals prevailing in the  United States.</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left"><strong>Panel's  findings</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The Panel recognized that an  ongoing bilateral process was taking place between China and the United States.  However, the Panel observed that this bilateral process seemed to be parallel  to the panel proceedings, and not intended, by China at least, to replace them.  The Panel found that the parties had not reached a settlement of the matter  within the meaning of the third sentence of Article 12.7 of the DSU </p>
            <p align="left">The &nbsp;Panel found that the challenged additional  duties were <em>prima facie</em> inconsistent with Article&nbsp;I:1 of the GATT  1994 because they applied only to products from China; and <em>prima facie</em> inconsistent with Article II of the GATT 1994, because they were applied in  excess of the rates to which the United States bound itself in its Schedule of  Concessions. </p>
            <p align="left">With respect to the United  States' defence under Article XX(a) of the GATT 1994, the Panel adopted a  holistic approach to determining whether the measures at issue were  &ldquo;necessary to protect public morals&rdquo;. This approach involved an overall  assessment based on the Panel's interpretation of each element of Article XX(a)  and on its application to the specific facts of this dispute. Following this  holistic approach, the Panel refrained from reaching any intermediate  conclusions before completing the entire analysis of whether the measures could  be shown by the United States to be provisionally justified.</p>
            <p align="left">With respect to the  identification of the public morals objective invoked by the United States, the  Panel observed that the &ldquo;standards of right and wrong&rdquo; invoked by the  United States (including norms against theft, misappropriation and unfair  competition) could &mdash; at least at a conceptual level &mdash; be covered by the concept  of &ldquo;public morals&rdquo; in Article XX(a). </p>
            <p align="left">With respect to the necessity of  the measures, the Panel focused its analysis on the United States' explanation  of how the specific measures that it chose to impose, i.e. additional duties on  a wide range of selected products from China, contributed to the public morals  objective invoked. The Panel directed its enquiry towards seeking to identify  the nexus between the measures the United States had chosen and the US public  morals concerns, in order to inform the examination of the question of whether  and how the measures contributed, and could therefore be demonstrated to be  &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;, to protect public morals within the meaning of Article  XX(a). </p>
            <p align="left">Regarding the imposition of  additional duties on List 1 products, the Panel found that the United States  had not provided an explanation demonstrating a genuine relationship of ends  and means between the imposition of additional duties on these products and the  public morals objective invoked by the United States. The Panel found, in  particular, that the United States had not provided evidence in support of its  assertion that the products on which it imposed additional duties benefitted  from practices of China that the United States considered to be contrary to its  public morals, nor evidence that would more generally demonstrate how the  additional duties it applied to selected products otherwise contributed to its  public morals objective. </p>
            <p align="left">Regarding the imposition of  additional duties on List 2 products, the Panel found that the United States  had not provided an explanation that would allow the Panel to understand an &ldquo;ends  and means&rdquo; relationship between the additional duties on List 2 products  and the public morals objective invoked by the United States. </p>
            <p align="left">In summary, the Panel concluded  that the United States had not provided an explanation demonstrating how the  imposition of additional duties on the selected imported products in List 1 and  List 2 was apt to contribute to the public morals objective invoked, and, following  on from that, how they were necessary to protect public morals. The Panel found,  accordingly, that the United States had not met its burden of demonstrating  that the measures are provisionally justified under Article XX(a). </p>
            <p align="left">The Panel Report contains  additional &ldquo;Concluding Comments&rdquo; emphasising the Panel's awareness of  the wider context in which the WTO system currently operates, which was  &ldquo;one reflecting a range of unprecedented global trade tensions&rdquo;. The  Panel pointed out that its role was not to draw any legal conclusions or make  recommendations on any matters other than those it had been specifically tasked  to deal with. In this connection, the Panel recalled that the Government of the  United States had not, up to the present time, initiated action under the WTO  DSU with respect to measures that China had imposed in response to the United  States measures at issue in this dispute. The Panel emphasized that it had  sought to perform diligently its adjudicatory role under Article 11 of the DSU  in relation to the matters that fell within its terms of reference. Finally,  the Panel expressed its encouragement to the parties to continue to work for a  mutually agreed solution to the matters raised in the dispute.</p>

    <p class="paranormaltext">On 26 October 2020, the United States notified the DSB  of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law and legal  interpretations in the panel report.</p>
