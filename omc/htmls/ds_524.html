        <h3>Consultations</h3>
         <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Mexico</strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 8 March 2017, Mexico requested consultations with Costa Rica with respect to certain measures imposed by Costa Rica that allegedly restrict or prohibit the importation of fresh avocados for consumption from Mexico.
</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Mexico claimed that the measures appear to be inconsistent with:
  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Articles 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 6.1, 6.2, 7, 8, Annex B(2), (5) and (6) and Annex C(1) of the SPS Agreement; and

      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body  proceedings</h3>
      <p align="left">On 22 November 2018, Mexico requested the  establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 4&nbsp;December&nbsp;2018, the DSB deferred  the establishment of a panel.</p>
      <p align="left">At its  meeting on 18 December 2018, the DSB established a panel. Canada, China, the  European Union, El Salvador, Honduras, India, Panama, the Russian Federation and the United  States reserved their third-party rights.</p>
      <p align="left">Following agreement of the parties, the panel was composed  on 16 May 2019.</p>
      <p align="left">On 15  November 2019, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that in light of the  substantive and procedural complexities of this dispute, the panel expected to  issue its final report to the parties by the second half of 2020. The Chair noted that the report would be available to the public  once it was circulated to the Members in all three official languages, and that  the date of circulation depended on completion of translation.</p>
      <p align="left">On 29 May 2020, Mexico and Costa Rica  informed the DSB that they had agreed to Procedures for Arbitration under  Article 25 of the DSU in this dispute. Such procedures were entered into by  Mexico and Costa Rica to give effect to the communication JOB/DSB/1/Add.12 (&ldquo;Multi-Party  Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement Pursuant To Article 25 Of The DSU  (MPIA)&rdquo;) and with the objective of setting a framework for an arbitrator  to decide on any appeal of any final panel report issued in this dispute.On 26 November  2021, Mexico and Costa Rica informed the DSB that they had agreed to a  revised version of the Procedures for Arbitration.</p>
      <p align="left">On  18 November 2020, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that in view of the  situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including the ongoing travel  restrictions and the health risks associated with travelling to meetings, the  panel, after consulting the parties, had decided to postpone the remaining  meetings and, given the substantive and procedural complexities of this  dispute, it now expected to issue its final report to the parties early in the  second half of 2021. The Chair apprised the DSB that the report would be  available to the public once it was circulated to the Members in all three  official languages, and that the date of circulation depended on completion of  translation. On 8 July 2021, the Chair of the panel informed  the DSB that in view of the situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, as well  as the substantive and procedural complexities of this dispute, the panel  expected to issue its final report to the parties in the last quarter of 2021. On 16 December  2021, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that in view of the situation  regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the  substantive and procedural complexities of this dispute, the panel expected to  issue its final report to the parties before the end of the first quarter of  2022.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="bkmk524r" name="bkmk524r"></a>On 13  April 2022, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

    	    <p align="left">This  dispute concerns certain measures imposed by Costa Rica on the importation of  fresh avocados for consumption from Mexico, related to Avocado sunblotch viroid  (ASBVd). Mexico challenged:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Two resolutions by the State Phytosanitary Service  of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock of Costa Rica (Resolutions  DSFE-003-2018 and DSFE-002-2018), issued on 29 January 2018, imposing certain phytosanitary  requirements related to ASBVd for imports of fresh avocado fruit.</li>
              <li>Two reports prepared by the Pest Risk Analysis Unit  of the State Phytosanitary Service (Reports ARP-002-2017 and ARP-006-2016),  dated 10 July 2017, containing the phytosanitary risk assessment with respect  to the risk of ASBVd.</li>
              <li>Manual NR-ARP-PO-01_M 01, of 10 May  2016, prepared by the Pest Risk Analysis Unit (UARP) of the SFE, which contains  the methodology for phytosanitary risk analysis that was used to prepare  Reports ARP-002-2017 and ARP-006-2016.</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Scope of the SPS Agreement</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The  Panel found that Mexico had demonstrated that Resolutions DSFE-002-2018 and  DSFE-003-2018, which contain the phytosanitary requirements, individually  constitute phytosanitary measures subject to the SPS Agreement. </p>
            <p align="left">The  Panel concluded that Mexico had failed to demonstrate that Reports ARP-002-2017  and ARP-006-2016 and Manual NR-ARP-PO-01_M-01 individually constitute  phytosanitary measures subject to the SPS Agreement.</p>
            <p align="left">The  Panel also found that Mexico had failed to demonstrate the existence of one  phytosanitary measure consisting of the five measures identified by Mexico as a  whole. However, in order to analyse the claims put forward by Mexico, the Panel  decided that it would read Resolutions DSFE-002-2018 and DSFE-003-2018, which  contain the phytosanitary requirements, together with Reports ARP-002-2017 and  ARP-006-2016 and Manual NR-ARP-PO-01_M-01, and would make any necessary  findings and recommendations in relation to those instruments, with a view to  securing a positive solution to the dispute.</p>
            <p><strong>Claims on risk assessment</strong></p>
            <p>The panel found that Costa Rica has acted inconsistently  with Article 5.1 of the SPS Agreement, by failing to ensure that its  phytosanitary measures are based on an assessment, as appropriate to the  circumstances, of the risks to plant life or health.</p>
            <p>The Panel also found that Costa Rica has acted  inconsistently with Article 5.2 of the SPS Agreement, because, in the  assessment of risks, it failed to take into account available scientific  evidence and the prevalence of specific disease or pests.</p>
            <p>The Panel found that Costa Rica has acted  inconsistently with Article 5.3 of the SPS Agreement, because, in assessing the  risk to plant life or health and determining the measure to be applied for  achieving the appropriate level of phytosanitary protection from such risk, it  failed to take into account as relevant economic factors: the potential damage  in terms of loss of production or sales in the event of the entry,  establishment or spread of ASBVd; the costs of control or eradication in Costa  Rica's territory; and the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative approaches  to limiting risks.</p>
            <p> Finally, the Panel found that Costa Rica has acted inconsistently  with Article 2.2 of the SPS Agreement, by failing to ensure that its  phytosanitary measures, i.e. Resolutions DSFE-002-2018 and DSFE-003-2018, which  contain the phytosanitary requirements, are based on scientific principles and  are not maintained without sufficient scientific evidence.</p>
            <p><strong>Claims on discrimination</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The  Panel found that, in respect of two situations that Mexico indicated as comparable,  i.e. fresh avocados imported for consumption from countries where ASBVd is  present <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em> domestic Costa Rican avocados in which Mexico alleged ASBVd  is likely to be present, there are arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions in  the levels of protection that Costa Rica considers to be appropriate in  different situations, which result in discrimination or a disguised restriction  on international trade. Therefore, the Panel concluded that Costa Rica has  acted inconsistently with Article 5.5 of the SPS Agreement.</p>
            <p align="left">The  Panel also found that Costa Rica's phytosanitary measures, i.e. Resolutions  DSFE-002-2018 and DSFE-003-2018, which contain the phytosanitary requirements,  arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between its own territory and that of  Mexico, and are applied in a manner which constitutes a disguised restriction on  international trade. Thus, the Panel concluded that Costa Rica has acted  inconsistently with the first and second sentences of Article 2.3 of the SPS  Agreement.</p>
            <p><strong>Claim on trade restrictiveness</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The  Panel found that Mexico had failed to demonstrate that Costa Rica has acted  inconsistently with Article 5.6 of the SPS Agreement.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Claims on adaptation to regional conditions</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The  Panel found that Mexico had failed to demonstrate that Costa Rica has acted  inconsistently with its obligation under Article 6.1 of the SPS Agreement.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Claims on harmonization</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The  Panel exercised judicial economy with regard to Mexico's claims under Articles  3.1 and 3.3 of the SPS Agreement.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Claims relating to general conformity with the SPS Agreement</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The  Panel found that Costa Rica has acted inconsistently with: (i) Article 1.1 of  the SPS Agreement, by failing to develop and apply its phytosanitary measures, i.e.  Resolutions DSFE-002-2018 and DSFE-003-2018, which contain the phytosanitary  requirements, in accordance with the provisions of the SPS Agreement; and (ii)  Article 2.1 of the SPS Agreement, by adopting phytosanitary measures that are  inconsistent with the provisions of the SPS Agreement.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Claims under the GATT 1994</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The  Panel exercised judicial economy with regard to Mexico's claims under Articles  III:4 and XI:1 of the GATT 1994, and Costa Rica's defence under Article XX(b)  of the GATT 1994.</p>
          </div>
