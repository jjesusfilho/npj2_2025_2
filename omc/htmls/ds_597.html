        <h3>Consultations</h3>
       <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Hong Kong, China</strong></p>
       <p align="left">On 30 October 2020, Hong Kong, China requested  consultations with the United States regarding certain measures concerning the  origin marking requirement applicable to goods produced in Hong Kong, China.</p>
       <p align="left"> Hong Kong, China claimed that measures appear to be  inconsistent with: </p>
       <ul>
         <li>Articles I:1,  IX:1 and X:3(a) of the GATT 1994; <br>
&nbsp;         </li>
         <li>Articles  2(c), 2(d) and 2(e) of the Agreement on Rules of Origin; and<br>
&nbsp;         </li>
         <li>Article 2.1  of the TBT Agreement.</li>
       </ul>
       <p align="left">On 9 November 2020, the  United States requested the Chair of the DSB to circulate to Members a  communication where it indicated that the United States accepted  Hong Kong, China's request  to enter  into consultations, without prejudice to the US view that  the measures imposed by the United States concern issues of national security  not susceptible to review or capable of resolution by WTO dispute settlement.</p>
       <p align="left"> On 13 November 2020, the Russian  Federation requested to join the consultations. On 19  November 2020, the United States requested the Chair of the DSB to circulate to  Members a communication where it rejected the Russian Federation's request to  join the consultations.</p>
       <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
       <h3>Panel and  Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
       <p align="left">
         On 14 January  2021, Hong Kong, China requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting  on 25 January 2021, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting  on 22 February 2021, the DSB established a panel. Brazil, Canada, China, the  European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Norway, the Russian Federation, Singapore,  Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine reserved their third-party rights.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 19 April 2021,  Hong Kong, China requested the  Director-General to compose the panel. On 29&nbsp;April  2021, the  Director-General composed the panel.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 26  October 2021, the Chair  of the panel informed the DSB that, in the light of  the complexity of the issues presented in the dispute,  the panel expected to  issue its final report to the parties in the second  quarter of 2022. In its communication, the Chair apprised the DSB that the  report would be available to the public once it was circulated to the Members  in all three official languages, and that the date of circulation depends on  completion of translation.&nbsp;On 21 June 2022, the  Chair of the panel informed the DSB that due to the complexity of the dispute, the panel now expected to  issue its final report to the parties in  the last quarter of 2022.</p>

      <p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="bkmk597r" name="bkmk597r"></a>On 21 December, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
    	    <p align="left">This dispute concerns a  requirement in US law that imported goods produced in Hong Kong, China be  marked to indicate that their origin is &ldquo;China&rdquo; (origin marking  requirement). </p>
            <p align="left">Through the 1992 Hong Kong Policy  Act, US Congress grants Hong Kong, China differential treatment from China in  certain policy areas (including origin marking), on the condition that Hong  Kong, China remains sufficiently autonomous from China. Following certain  events in Hong Kong, China, including the adoption of the Hong Kong Security  Law by China in 2020, the US President issued Executive Order 13936, determining  that Hong Kong, China was no longer sufficiently autonomous and ordering  suspension of the differential treatment in some areas (including origin  marking). This led to the adoption of the origin marking requirement at issue.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Order of  analysis</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The Panel considered it  appropriate to start its analysis with Hong Kong, China's claim under Article  IX:1 of the GATT 1994. In light of the United States' invocation of Article  XXI(b) of the GATT 1994, the Panel next decided that it was appropriate and also  the most efficient way to proceed, to examine the question of whether this  provision is self-judging such that it excludes any review of the challenged  measure by a panel, as argued by the United States. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Whether Article  XXI(b) is entirely self-judging</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The Panel saw no disagreement  between the parties on that Article XXI(b) contains language (&ldquo;which it  considers&rdquo;) which refers to the invoking Member's own appreciation and  judgement and is therefore &ldquo;self-judging&rdquo;. The Panel identified the  disagreement to be about whether, as argued by the United States, the phrase  &ldquo;which it considers&rdquo; extends to the entirety of Article XXI(b), or,  whether, as submitted by Hong Kong, China and certain third parties, this  phrase does not extend to the conditions and circumstances set out in the  sub-paragraphs which would therefore be subject to review by the Panel. </p>
            <p align="left">The Panel carried out an  interpretive analysis pursuant to Articles 31 and 33 of the Vienna Convention  on the Law of Treaties. Based on this analysis the Panel concluded that the  words &ldquo;which it considers&rdquo; in the chapeau of Article XXI(b) do not  extend to the subparagraphs of that provision and that therefore the  subparagraphs in Article XXI(b) are subject to review by a panel. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Article IX:1 of  the GATT 1994</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The Panel found that the measure  constitutes an origin marking requirement that falls within the scope of Article  IX:1, and that products produced in Hong Kong, China, which are subject to the measure,  and products produced in any third country, which are not subject to the measure,  could be presumed to be &ldquo;like products&rdquo; within the meaning of Article  IX:1.</p>
            <p align="left">To assess whether the origin  marking requirement accords to products of Hong Kong, China treatment that is different  from the treatment accorded to products of other countries, the Panel first resolved  a factual disagreement between the parties concerning the origin determination  at issue. It found that the United States determines the origin of the products  subject to the measure to be &ldquo;Hong Kong, China&rdquo; and not  &ldquo;China&rdquo;. </p>
            <p align="left">The Panel found that a difference  in treatment resulted from the United&nbsp;States requiring that products of  Hong Kong, China be marked with a mark of origin indicating the name of another  WTO Member (China), whereas goods of any third country must be marked with the  name of that third country, and not with the name of another WTO Member. The  Panel further found that this difference in treatment modified the conditions of  competition to the detriment of products of Hong Kong, China, because, as a  result, products of Hong Kong, China were required to compete in the US market  with an indication that their origin is that of another WTO Member (China) and  not with an indication of their origin as determined by the United&nbsp;States  (i.e. Hong Kong, China). Those products were thus denied the possibility to  compete in the US market under their own name, and thus to influence, develop,  or benefit from, any value that may be attached, currently or in the future, to  their origin</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>United States'  invocation of Article XXI(b)(iii)</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The Panel first addressed the  interpretive and evidentiary aspects of subparagraph (iii) which the United  States had indicated to be the relevant subparagraph in Article XXI(b). </p>
            <p align="left">The Panel concluded that the  phrase &quot;emergency in international relations&quot; refers to a state of  affairs of the utmost gravity, in effect a situation representing a breakdown  or near-breakdown in the relations between states or other participants in  international relations. The Panel found that the wording of the subparagraph  enjoins a panel to examine the extent of the deterioration in relations between  states or other participants in international relations, irrespective of what  caused that deterioration. The Panel further noted that whether such situation  exists must be assessed on a case-by-case basis in light of the specific facts  involved. It considered that the state of relevant international relations may  be understood in a spectrum between peaceful interaction on one end, and the  breakdown in such relations on the other end (in situations such as war). In  the Panel's view, an emergency in international relations was closer to this  latter end, i.e. a breakdown in such relations. </p>
            <p align="left">Applying this interpretation to  the facts at hand, the Panel concluded that although there was evidence of the  United&nbsp;States and other Members being highly concerned about the human  rights situation in Hong Kong, China, the situation had not escalated to a threshold  of requisite gravity to constitute an emergency in international relations that  would provide justification for taking actions that are inconsistent with  obligations under the GATT&nbsp;1994. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Judicial economy</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The Panel exercised judicial  economy with respect to Hong Kong, China's claims under Article I:1 of the GATT  1994, Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement, and Articles 2(c) and 2(d) of the ARO. With respect to Article I:1 of the GATT 1994 and Article  2.1 of the TBT Agreement, the Panel did not consider that additional findings  on an MFN violation would be necessary to assist the DSB in making sufficiently  precise recommendations and rulings. The Panel's conclusion on exercising  judicial economy on the claims under the ARO was grounded on the factual finding  that the United States determines the origin of the products to be &ldquo;Hong  Kong, China&rdquo; and not &ldquo;China&rdquo;, which meant that the factual basis for contending that the dispute involved  &ldquo;rules of origin&rdquo; within the meaning of the ARO was incorrect.</p>
          </div>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 26 January 2023, the United States notified the  DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law and  legal interpretations in the panel report. On  1 February 2023, Hong Kong, China informed the DSB that it had taken note of the  United States' notification of its appeal and that, given the current  non-operational situation of the Appellate Body, it considered that all  subsequent procedural deadlines set out in the Appellate Body's Working  Procedures were suspended. Hong Kong, China also noted that the United States  did not file an appellant submission in accordance with Rule 21(1) of the  Appellate Body's Working Procedures. Hong Kong, China further indicated that it  reserved its full right to file its own appeal on issues of law and legal  interpretation in the panel report and to respond to the United States' appeal,  and that it would await the instructions of the Appellate Body in this respect.</p>
