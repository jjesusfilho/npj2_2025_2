        <h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by China.&nbsp;  </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 17 April   2009, China  requested consultations with the United States  concerning certain measures taken by the United    States affecting the import of poultry products  from China.&nbsp; The measure primarily at issue is Section 727  of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009, which effectively prohibits the  establishment or implementation of any measures that would allow Chinese  poultry to be imported into the United States  because it denies the use of any funding by USDA for this purpose.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> China considers that the United States, through Section  727 and any closely related measures, is in violation, at a minimum, of  Articles I:1 and XI:1 of GATT 1994 and  Article 4.2 of the Agriculture Agreement.&nbsp;  In addition, China also specifies that, although it does not believe  that the US measure or any closely related measures at issue constitute  sanitary and phytosanitary measures within the meaning of the SPS Agreement, if  it were demonstrated that any such measure is a SPS measure, China would  consider such measure also to be in violation of US obligations under various  provisions of the SPS Agreement.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 23 June   2009, China  requested the establishment of a panel.&nbsp;  At its meeting on 20 July 2009,  the DSB deferred the establishment of the panel.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 31 July 2009, the DSB established a panel.&nbsp; The European Communities, Guatemala,  Korea and Turkey  reserved their third-party rights.&nbsp; Subsequently,  Brazil and  Chinese Taipei reserved their third-party rights.&nbsp; On 16   September 2009, China  requested the Director-General to compose the panel.&nbsp; On 23&nbsp;September   2009, the Director-General composed the panel.    On 23 March 2010, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that  it would not be able to complete its work within six months from the date of  the panel's composition due to the technical complexity of the matter and the  parties' requests to postpone a number of deadlines during the  proceedings.&nbsp; The panel estimated that it will issue  its final report to the parties by July 2010.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 29  September 2010, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">The panel found that with  respect to the requests for preliminary rulings:</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China's SPS claims were within the panel's terms of  reference. The panel disagreed with the United&nbsp;States' request of  rejecting the SPS claims. Rather, it found that China had requested  consultations pursuant to Article&nbsp;11 of the SPS Agreement and had also  indicated the various provisions of that Agreement that were the basis for its  claims.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China, in its oral statement at the first substantive  meeting, requested a preliminary ruling that Section 743 of the AAA of 2010 was  also within the panel's terms of reference. After the meeting, the panel  notified China that it would withhold its ultimate decision on the matter until  the Interim Report. China then notified the panel that it would not be pursuing  claims with respect to Section 743 in this dispute, but reserved its right to  make future claims against that provision.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">The panel also found that with  respect to China's claims under the SPS Agreement:</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp;727 satisfied the two conditions in  Article&nbsp;1 of the SPS Agreement for a measure to be considered an SPS  measure within the scope of the SPS Agreement. First, Section&nbsp;727 was  enacted for the purpose of protecting human and animal life and health from the  risk posed by the prospect of the importation of contaminated poultry products  from China and was therefore a measure applied for the purpose set forth in  Annex&nbsp;A(1)(b) of the SPS Agreement. Second, the panel concluded that Section&nbsp;727  directly or indirectly affected international trade in poultry products.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The panel next examined China's SPS claims and concluded that  Section 727 was inconsistent with: </p>
    
      <p class="paranormaltext">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article&nbsp;5.1 and 5.2 of the  SPS Agreement because it is not based on a risk assessment which took into  account the factors set forth in Article&nbsp;5.2;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article&nbsp;2.2 of the SPS  Agreement because it was maintained without sufficient scientific evidence;</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article&nbsp;5.5 of the SPS  Agreement because the distinction in  ALOPs for poultry products from China and for poultry products from other WTO  Members is arbitrary or  unjustifiable and that this arbitrary or unjustifiable distinction in ALOPs results in discrimination against  China;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article&nbsp;2.3 of the SPS  Agreement, first sentence, because the inconsistency of Section&nbsp;727 with  Article&nbsp;5.5 of the SPS Agreement necessarily implies that  Section&nbsp;727 is also inconsistent with Article&nbsp;2.3 of the SPS  Agreement;</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article&nbsp;8 of the SPS  Agreement because Section&nbsp;727 has caused an undue delay in the FSIS  approval procedures and thus the United States failed to observe the provisions  of Annex&nbsp;C(1)(a) of the SPS Agreement.</p>
    
    <p class="paranormaltext">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp; The panel declined to rule on China's claim that Section 727  is inconsistent with Article&nbsp;5.6 of the SPS Agreement, as it considered that it would be exceeding  its role under Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU to make an objective assessment of  the matter. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">With respect  to China's claims under the GATT 1994 and the United States' defence under Article&nbsp;XX(b) of the  GATT 1994, the panel found that:</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding its findings of inconsistency under the  SPS&nbsp;Agreement, the panel decided to proceed with its analysis of China's GATT claims and the United States' defence under Article&nbsp;XX(b) of the  GATT&nbsp;1994. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  panel found that  Section 727 was inconsistent with:</p>
    
      <p class="paranormaltext">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article&nbsp;I:1  of the GATT 1994 because the United&nbsp;States was not extending immediately or unconditionally to the like products  originating from China an advantage that it has extended to all other WTO Members;</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article&nbsp;XI:1  of the GATT 1994, because during the time it was in operation, Section&nbsp;727 imposed a prohibition on the  importation of poultry products from China. </p>
    
    <p class="paranormaltext">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp; The panel then found that  Section&nbsp;727 was not justified under Article&nbsp;XX(b) of the  GATT&nbsp;1994 because it had found that it was inconsistent with  Articles&nbsp;2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.5 of the SPS Agreement.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">With respect  to China's  claims under Article 4.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, the panel, on the basis of  judicial economy, refrained from ruling on China's claim under Article&nbsp;4.2  of the Agreement on Agriculture, because it had found that Section&nbsp;727 was  inconsistent with Article&nbsp;XI:1 of the GATT&nbsp;1994. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">Although the panel found several  violations, it did not recommend that the DSB requests the United States to bring the measure at issue  (Section 727) into conformity with its obligations under the SPS Agreement and the GATT 1994, because Section 727 had already  expired. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting  on 25 October 2010, the DSB adopted the panel report.</p></div>
