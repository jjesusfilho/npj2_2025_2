        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Argentina. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 30 August 2012, Argentina requested consultations  with the United States concerning certain  measures affecting the importation of animals, meat and other animal products  from Argentina.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The specific  measures challenged by Argentina are: </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> (i) the  import prohibition of fresh (chilled or frozen) beef from Argentina embodied  in the interim and final rule of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  (APHIS), which amend the regulations of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> (ii) the failure to recognize certain areas  of Argentina's territory as free of foot-and-mouth disease embodied in the APHIS  Policy Regarding Importation of Animals and Animal Products; and </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> (iii) alleged  undue delays in recognizing the animal health status of a region or in granting  approval to export animals or animal products from that region with both types of delay occurring under  procedures embodied in the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); and additional  conditions on importation allegedly imposed by &nbsp;Section 737 of the Omnibus Act&nbsp;2009. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Argentina claims that the challenged measures  appear to be inconsistent with:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">Articles I:1, III:4 and XI:1 of the GATT 1994;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">Articles 1.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4,  5.6, 6.1, 6.2, 8 and Annex C.1, and Article&nbsp;10.1 of the SPS Agreement; and<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">Article XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 6 December 2012, Argentina  requested the establishment of a panel.&nbsp; At its meeting on 17&nbsp;December&nbsp;2012,  the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 28 January 2013, the DSB established  a panel.&nbsp; Australia, China, the European&nbsp;Union,  India and Korea reserved their third party rights. On 29 July 2013, Argentina requested the  Director-General to compose the panel. On 8 August 2013, the  Director-General composed the panel. On 7  March 2014, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that, taking  into account the scale and complexity of the dispute, the  panel expects to issue its final report to the parties in  early 2015.</p>
              <p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="bkmk447r" name="bkmk447r"></a>On 24 July 2015, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">This dispute concerns the United  States' maintenance of an import prohibition on all Foot-and-Mouth disease  (FMD) susceptible animals and animal products from Argentina imposed following an  outbreak of FMD in Northern Argentina in 2001. The general ban is set forth in Section 94.1 of Title 9 of the United  States' Code of Federal Regulations. Argentina requested re-authorization  to import (i) fresh (chilled or frozen) beef from Northern Argentina and (ii)  all FMD-susceptible animals and animal products from Patagonia in 2002. </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">Argentina claimed that the  prohibition embodied in 9 CFR 94.1(b) is inconsistent with Articles 1.1 2.2,  2.3, 3.1, 3.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6, 5.7, and 10.1 of the Agreement on Sanitary  and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) and Articles I:1 and XI:1 of the  GATT 1994. With respect to the prohibition on all ruminant products from Patagonia,  Argentina also claimed that the United States' measure was inconsistent with  the regionalization provisions in Articles 6.1 and 6.2 of the SPS Agreement. </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">Argentina argued that the ban  lacked scientific justification and was maintained contrary to international  standards, without a valid risk assessment, and in a discriminatory manner that  was more trade-restrictive than required to meet the US level of protection. Argentina  also claimed that the United States had imposed an undue delay in the approval  procedures on Argentina&rsquo;s requests regarding authorization of imports of fresh  beef and recognition of the Patagonia region as FMD-free. Argentina also argued  that, with respect to products from Patagonia, the United States had not  complied with its obligations to adapt its measures to pest- or disease-free  areas and to recognize the concept that such areas exist. Finally, Argentina  also made claims with respect to the way the United States determined its level  of protection and whether the United States had properly accorded Argentina  special and differential treatment as a developing country Member.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">In response, the United States noted  that FMD is considered to be one of the most infectious and economically  devastating livestock diseases. The United States also explained that it had  not had a case of FMD for more than 80 years and that livestock in the United  States are not vaccinated against FMD. Thus an outbreak would be particularly  devastating to the US economy. The United States asserted that the review by the  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) &mdash; the relevant agency of the  Department of Agriculture &mdash; of Argentina&rsquo;s applications for authorisation to  import had been undertaken without undue delay in light of the need for new and  updated information on the situation in Argentina. In that same vein, the  United States argued that its measures were covered under the exemption in  Article 5.7 of the SPS Agreement, which allows for measures to be adopted in  cases where relevant scientific evidence is insufficient. The United States  contended that, as the measures were covered by the exemption in Article 5.7,  there could be no inconsistency with Articles 2.2, 5.1, 5.6 and 6.1 of the SPS  Agreement.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">The United States argued that  its measures were based on the standards of the World Animal Health  Organization (OIE) because APHIS's procedures follow the same approach as those  embodied in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, in that they require an  application from an exporting area and a review of that area's FMD status. However,  the United States also argued that, in connection with the claim regarding  Northern Argentina, the provisions of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code that  call for permitting beef imports from countries that are FMD-free where  vaccination is practised are not sufficient to achieve the United States' appropriate  level of protection. The United States' position is that systematic vaccination  introduces risks related to the immunological response within the vaccinated  herd and thus an area or region that vaccinates cannot be considered FMD-free.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">As in nearly all disputes  brought under the SPS Agreement, the Panel consulted with scientific experts to  assist it in evaluating the scientific evidence. In particular, experts were  engaged in the areas of risk assessment techniques, veterinary practices,  and surveillance in the context of foot-and-mouth disease. The Panel also  consulted with the OIE concerning the operation and interpretation of its Terrestrial  Animal Health Code.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">The Panel found that:</p>

&nbsp;                            </li>
                            <li class="paranormaltext">The United  States' measures as applied to Patagonia are inconsistent with <strong>Article 6.1</strong> <strong>of the SPS&nbsp;Agreement </strong>because they are not adapted to the SPS  characteristics of the Patagonia region;<br />

                            <li class="paranormaltext">Argentina did  not make a <em>prima facie </em>case that the  United States' measures are inconsistent with <strong>Article 10.1 of the SPS Agreement </strong>requiring that the United States  take account of Argentina's special needs as a developing country member;<br />

                            <li class="paranormaltext">In light of  the above, the United States' measures are consequentially inconsistent with <strong>Articles 1 and 3.3 of the SPS Agreement;</strong></li>

            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">Having found that the United  States' measures are inconsistent with the above provisions of the  SPS&nbsp;Agreement, the Panel exercised judicial economy on Argentina's claims  under <strong>Articles I:1 </strong>(MFN) and<strong>&nbsp;XI:1&nbsp;of the GATT&nbsp;1994 </strong>(Quantitative  Restrictions) as well as the United States' defence under <strong>Article XX(b) </strong>(necessary to protect animal life or health)<strong> of the GATT 1994</strong>.</p>
