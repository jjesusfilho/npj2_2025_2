        <h3>Consultations</h3>
         <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the European Union</strong></p>
        <p align="left">On 22 November 2019, the European Union requested  consultations with Indonesia regarding various measures concerning certain raw  materials necessary for the production of stainless steel, as well as a  cross-sectoral import duty exemption scheme conditional upon the use of  domestic over imported goods. The request covers the following alleged  measures: (a) restrictions on exports of nickel, including an actual  prohibition to export; (b) domestic processing requirements for nickel, iron  ore, chromium and coal; (c) domestic marketing obligations for nickel and coal  products; (d) export licensing requirements for nickel; and (e) a prohibited  subsidy scheme. </p>
        <p align="left">The European Union claimed that: </p>
         <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
           <li>the measures restricting the  exports of certain raw materials, including those requiring domestic processing  requirements, domestic marketing obligations, and export licensing  requirements, appear to be inconsistent with Article XI:1 of the GATT 1994;<br>
&nbsp;           </li>
           <li>the prohibited subsidy scheme  appears to be inconsistent with Article 3.1(b) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement; and <br>
&nbsp;           </li>
           <li>the failure to promptly  publish the challenged measures appears to be inconsistent with  Article&nbsp;X:1 of the GATT 1994.</li>
         </ol>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 6 December 2019,  the United States requested to join the consultations.</p>

        <h3>Panel and  Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p align="left">
          On 14 January 2021, the European Union requested  the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 25 January 2021, the DSB  deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
<p class="paranormaltext">At  its meeting on 22 February 2021, the DSB established a panel. Brazil, Canada,  China, India, Japan, Korea, the Russian Federation,  Saudi Arabia, Singapore,  Chinese Taipei, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom,  and the United States reserved their third-party rights.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 19 April 2021,  the European Union requested the Director-General to compose the panel. On 29  April 2021,  the Director-General composed the panel.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On  1 November 2021, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that, in accordance  with the timetable adopted thus far following consultations with the parties,  the panel estimated that it would issue its final report to the parties in the last  quarter of 2022. In its communication, the Chair apprised the DSB that the  report would be available to the public once it was circulated to the Members  in all three official languages, and that the date of circulation depends on  completion of translation.</p>

    	    <p>This dispute concerns Indonesia's imposition of two measures  that the European Union claimed prevent the export of nickel ore. The European  Union challenged (a) a prohibition on the exportation of nickel ore and; (b) a  domestic processing requirement (DPR) for all nickel ore. These measures were  implemented through various laws and regulations. </p>
            <p>The European Union requested the Panel to find that the  export ban and DPR were inconsistent with Article XI:1 of the GATT 1994. In response, Indonesia argued that the European Union had  failed to establish a <em>prima facie</em> case that the DPR was inconsistent  with Article XI:1 of the GATT 1994. Further, Indonesia argued that the export  ban and DPR were exempt from the obligation in Article XI:1 as they were export  prohibitions or restrictions temporarily applied to prevent an imminent  critical shortage of a product essential to Indonesia within the meaning of  Article XI:2(a) of the GATT 1994. Alternatively, Indonesia argued that the  measures were justified under Article XX(d) of the GATT 1994.</p>
            <p><strong>Articles XI:1 and XI:2(a) of the GATT 1994 (quantitative  restrictions)</strong></p>
            <p>The Panel found, and both parties agreed, that the export  ban was a prohibition on the export of nickel ore. With respect to the DPR, the  Panel was of the view that because Article XI:1 also covers measures  prohibiting or restricting &ldquo;sale for export&rdquo; it applied to domestic  regulations such as the DPR that prevent or limit the ability to sell goods for  export even if they apply internally within the exporting Member. The Panel  concluded that as the DPR by its nature restricted the sale for export of  nickel ore, it was fell within the scope of the obligation in Article XI:1 of  the GATT 1994.</p>
            <p>Addressing Indonesia's arguments under Article XI:2(a) of  the GATT 1994, the Panel first examined whether the measures applied to an  essential product. With respect to low-grade ore, the Panel noted that  Indonesia argued that low-grade ore was waste and not economically viable. The  Panel could not, therefore, conclude that low-grade ore was an essential  product. The Panel found that &nbsp;Indonesia  had not demonstrated through evidence pertaining to employment and revenue in  the relevant industries, that these industries were of a nature that ensuring  their supply of nickel ore was essential within the meaning of Article XI:2(a).  Then, the Panel analysed the duration of the export ban and DPR and found that  they had not been &ldquo;temporarily applied&rdquo; as the export ban had been in  place for seven years, albeit with short breaks for the exportation of  low-grade nickel ore, and for nine years in the case of DPR prior to the  establishment of the panel. The Panel noted that both measures remained in  effect as of the drafting of the Panel Report. The Panel also found that  Indonesia had not provided any basis to determine that there was a critical  shortage of low-grade nickel ore. With respect to high-grade nickel ore the  Panel found that Indonesia had not demonstrated, by evidence of the level of  reserves and projection of demand, that there was an imminent critical shortage.  The Panel concluded that an imbalance between supply and demand was not  sufficient to rise to the level of a critical shortage. Consequently, the Panel  found that Indonesia had not demonstrated that its measures were temporarily  applied to either prevent or relieve a critical shortage of an essential  product within the meaning of Article XI:2(a).</p>
            <p>Having found that the export ban and DPR were not exempt from  Article XI:1, the Panel held that they were inconsistent with Article XI:1 of  the GATT 1994 as the export ban prohibited exports and the DPR was a  restriction which had a limiting effect on exports.</p>
            <p><strong>Article XX(d) of the GATT 1994 (general exceptions &mdash;  necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations)</strong></p>
            <p>The Panel concluded that Indonesia  had failed to demonstrate that the export ban and DPR fell within the scope of  Article XX(d) as measures necessary to secure compliance with Indonesian laws  or regulations that are not inconsistent with GATT 1994. </p>
            <p>In arriving at its conclusion, the  Panel found that of the three legal provisions Indonesia identified as the laws  or regulations its measures were necessary to secure compliance with, only  Article 96(c) of Law No. 4/2009 on Coal and Mining relating to sustainable  mining and mineral resource management had the requisite normativity or  specificity to qualify as a law or regulation within the meaning of Article  XX(d) of the GATT 1994. Although the Panel found that protection of the  environment was a value of high importance, the Panel also found that the  export ban and DPR are highly trade-restrictive measures and neither is apt to make a &ldquo;material  contribution&rdquo; to securing compliance with Article 96(c) of Law No. 4/2009.  Moreover, the European Union had presented an alternative measure &mdash; an export  authorization system &mdash; was found to be less trade restrictive, achieved the  same level of contribution as the challenged measures to securing compliance  with Article 96(c) of Law 4/2009, and was reasonably available to Indonesia. The  Panel, therefore, concluded that Indonesia had failed to demonstrate that its  measures were necessary within the meaning of subparagraph (d). In light of  this conclusion, the Panel did not proceed to determine whether Indonesia's  measures complied with the non-discrimination requirements in the <em>chapeau</em> of Article XX.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Based on the findings outlined above, the Panel recommended that  Indonesia bring its measures into conformity with its obligations under the  GATT 1994.<u></u></p>

    <p class="paranormaltext">On  8 December 2022, Indonesia notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the  Appellate Body certain issues of law and legal interpretations in the panel  report. On 12  December 2022, the  European Union informed the  DSB that it had taken note of Indonesia's  notification of its appeal and that, given the current non-operational  situation of the Appellate Body, it considered that all subsequent procedural  deadlines set out in the Appellate Body's Working Procedures were to  be  considered  as suspended. The European  Union indicated that when the Appellate Body resumes its  functions, it should set the schedule for this appeal. The  European Union further indicated its  intention to file a written submission and make an oral statement in accordance  with the schedule to be determined by the Appellate Body. The  European Union noted its  disagreement with Indonesia's  appeal.</p>
