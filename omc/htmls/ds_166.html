		<h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the European Communities. </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 17 March
      1999, the EC requested consultations with the US in respect of definitive
      safeguard measures imposed by the US on imports of wheat gluten from the
      European Communities. The EC contended that by a Proclamation of 30 May
      1998, and a Memorandum of the same date, by the US President, under which
      the US imposed definitive safeguard measures in the form of a quantitative
      limitation on imports of wheat gluten from the EC, effective as of 1 June
      1998. The EC considered these measures to be in violation of Articles 2,
      4, 5 and 12 of the Agreement on Safeguards; Article 4.2 of the Agreement
      on Agriculture; and Articles I and XIX of GATT 1994.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 3 June 1999, the EC requested the establishment of a
      panel. At its meeting on 16 June 1999, the DSB deferred the establishment
      of a panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Further to a second request to establish a panel, the DSB
        established a panel at its meeting on 26 July 1999. Australia, Canada and
        New Zealand reserved their third-party rights. On 11 October 1999, the
        Panel was composed. The report of the panel was circulated to Members on
        31 July 2000. The panel found that:</p>
      <ol class="paranormaltext" type="i">
        <li>the United States had not acted inconsistently with
      Articles 2.1 and 4 of the Safeguards Agreement or with Article XIX:1(a) of
      the GATT 1994 in</li>
      </ol>
      
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>redacting certain confidential information from the
      published USITC Report or<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>determining the existence of imports in “increased
      quantities” and serious injury.</li>
      </ul>
      

      <ol class="paranormaltext" type="i" start="2">
        <li> the definitive safeguard measure imposed by the US
      on certain imports of wheat gluten based on the US investigation and
      determination was inconsistent with Articles 2.1 and 4 of the Safeguards
      Agreement in that</li>
      </ol>
      
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>the causation analysis applied by the USITC did not
      ensure that injury caused by other factors was not attributed to imports
      and<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>imports from Canada (a NAFTA partner) were excluded
      from the application of the measure after imports from all sources were
      included in the investigation for the purposes of determining serious
      injury caused by increased imports (following a separate inquiry
      concerning whether imports from Canada accounted for a “substantial
      share” of total imports and whether they “contributed
      importantly” to the “serious injury” caused by total
      imports).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ol class="paranormaltext" type="i" start="3">
        <li>The panel further concluded that the US failed to
      notify immediately the initiation of the investigation under Article
      12.1(a) and the finding of serious injury under Article 12.1(b) of the
      Safeguards Agreement.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>in notifying its decision to take the measure only
      after the measure was implemented, the US did not make timely notification
      under Article 12.1(c). For the same reason, the US violated the obligation
      of Article 12.3 to provide adequate opportunity for prior consultations on
      the measure.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the US therefore also violated its obligation under
      Article 8.1 of the Safeguards Agreement to endeavour to maintain a
      substantially equivalent level of concessions and other obligations to
      that existing under the GATT 1994 between it and the exporting Members
      which would be affected by such measures, in accordance with Article 12.3
      of the Safeguards Agreement.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 26 September 2000, the US notified its decision to
      appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law and legal
      interpretation covered in the Panel Report and certain legal
      interpretations developed by the Panel. The Appellate Body circulated its
      report on 22 December 2000. The Appellate Body:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>upheld the Panel’s conclusion that the US had not acted
      inconsistently with its obligations under Articles 4.2(a) and 4.2(b) of
      the Safeguards Agreement, but, in so doing, reversed the Panel’s
      interpretation of Article 4.2(a) of the Safeguards Agreement that the
      competent authorities are required to evaluate only the “relevant
      factors” listed in Article 4.2(a) of that Agreement as well as any
      other “factors” which were clearly raised before the competent
      authorities as relevant by the interested parties in the domestic
      investigation;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>reversed the Panel’s interpretation of Article 4.2(b)
      of the Safeguards Agreement that increased imports “alone”, “in and of themselves”, or
          “<i>per se</i>”, must be
      capable of causing “serious injury”, as well as the Panel’s
      conclusions on the issue of causation;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>found, nonetheless, that the US had acted
      inconsistently with its obligations under Article 4.2(b) of the Safeguards
      Agreement;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>upheld the Panel’s finding that the US had acted
      inconsistently with its obligations under Articles 2.1 and 4.2 of the
      Safeguards Agreement;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>upheld the Panel’s findings that the US had acted
      inconsistently with its obligations under Articles 12.1(a) and 12.1(b) of
      the Safeguards Agreement;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>reversed the Panel’s finding that the US had acted
      inconsistently with its obligations under Article 12.1(c) of the
      Safeguards Agreement; found that the US had acted consistently with its
      obligations under Article 12.1(c) of that Agreement to notify “immediately” its decision to apply a safeguard measure;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>upheld the Panel’s finding that the US had acted
      inconsistently with its obligations under Article 12.3 of the Safeguards
      Agreement, and, in consequence, upheld the Panel’s finding that the US had
      acted inconsistently with its obligations under Article 8.1 of the
      Safeguards Agreement;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the Panel did not act inconsistently with Article 11 of
      the DSU in concluding that the USITC had “considered industry
      productivity as required by Article 4.2(a)” of the Safeguards
      Agreement;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the Panel did not act inconsistently in finding that
      the USITC was not required to evaluate the overall relationship between
      the protein content of wheat and the price of wheat gluten as a “relevant factor”, under Article 4.2(a) of the Safeguards
      Agreement, during the post-1994 period of investigation; and,<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the Panel did not act inconsistently in declining to
      draw “adverse” inferences from the refusal of the US to provide
      certain allegedly confidential information requested from it by the Panel
      under Article 13.1 of the DSU;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the Panel acted inconsistently with Article 11 of the
      DSU in finding that “the USITC Report provides an adequate, reasoned
      and reasonable explanation with respect to ‘profits and losses’” and,
      therefore, reversed this finding; and found no error in the Panel’s
      exercise of judicial economy in not examining the claims of the EC under
      Article XIX:1(a) of the GATT 1994, and also under Article 5 of the
      Safeguards Agreement and Article I of the GATT 1994.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting of 19 January 2001, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body
      report and the Panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body report.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Implementation  of adopted reports</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext">At the
      DSB meeting of 16 February 2001, the US announced that it intended to
      implement the recommendations and rulings contained in the panel and
      Appellate Body reports. On 20 March 2001, the EC requested that the
      reasonable period of time for implementation be determined by binding
      arbitration pursuant to Article 21.3(c) DSU. On 10 April 2001, the parties
      to the dispute notified the DSB that they had mutually agreed that the
      reasonable period of time shall be four months and 14 days, that is from
    19 January 2001 to 2 June 2001.</p></div>
