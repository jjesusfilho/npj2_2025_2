		<h3>Consultations</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the United  States.&nbsp; (See also <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds113_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS113</a>) </strong></p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 8 October 1997, the United  States requested consultations with Canada in respect of export subsidies  allegedly granted by Canada on dairy products and the administration by Canada  of the tariff-rate quota on milk. The United States contended that these export  subsidies by Canada distort markets for dairy products and adversely affect US  sales of dairy products. The United&nbsp;States alleged violations of Articles  II, X and X1 of the GATT 1994, Articles 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 of the Agreement on  Agriculture, Article 3 of the SCM Agreement, and Articles 1, 2 and 3 of the  Import Licensing Agreement.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 2 February 1998, the United  States requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 13&nbsp;February  1998, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> Further to a second request by  the United States, at its meeting on 25 March 1998, the DSB established a  single panel, pursuant to Article 9.1 of the DSU, to examine this dispute and  DS113. Australia and Japan reserved their third-party rights. On 12 August  1998, the panel was composed. </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 17 May 1999, the panel report  was circulated to Members. The panel found that the measures complained against  were inconsistent with Canada&rsquo;s obligations under Article II:1(b) of the GATT&nbsp;1994,  and Articles 3.3 and 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture by providing export  subsidies as listed in Article 9.1(a) and 9.1(c) of the Agreement on  Agriculture.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 15 July 1999, Canada  notified the DSB of its decision to appeal certain issues of law and legal  interpretations developed by the panel. On 13 October 1999, the Appellate Body report  was circulated to Members. The Appellate Body:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">reversed the panel&rsquo;s interpretation of Article  9.1(a) and, in consequence, reversed the panel&rsquo;s finding that Canada acted  inconsistently with its obligations under Article 3.3 and 8 of the Agreement on  Agriculture.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">upheld the panel&rsquo;s finding that Canada was in  violation of Article 3.3 and 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture in respect of  export subsidies listed in Article 9.1(c) of the Agreement on  Agriculture.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">partly reversed the panel&rsquo;s finding that Canada  acted inconsistently with its obligations under Article II:1(b) of the GATT  1994. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 27 October  1999, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the Panel report, as  modified by the Appellate Body report.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 19  November 1999, Canada informed the DSB that it intended to fully implement the DSB  recommendations and rulings.&nbsp; On 23  December 1999, Canada and the United States informed the DSB that, pursuant to  Article 21.3 of the DSU and after having agreed to extend the time periods set  forth in Article 21.3(b) of the DSU, they had reached an agreement on four  discrete periods of time to be accorded a staged implementation process.  According to the implementation agreement, Canada must complete the last stage  of the implementation process no later than 31 December 2000. On 11 December  2000, Canada and the United States informed the DSB that they had agreed to  extend the reasonable period of time until 31 January 2001.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Compliance proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 22 December 2000, Canada  and the United States informed the DSB of an Understanding regarding procedures  under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU.&nbsp; On  2 February 2001, the United States requested consultations pursuant to Article  21.5 of the DSU claiming that Canada had failed to implement the DSB  recommendations and rulings by substituting the Special Class 5(e) export  subsidies by new programmes that allow exporters to purchase milk at prices  below the prevailing market levels in Canada for milk used in dairy products  sold into Canada's domestic market and by retaining the Special Class 5(d)  export subsidy found to be an export subsidy. On 16 February 2001, the United States  requested the establishment of a compliance panel.&nbsp; In parallel, the United States also requested  the DSB authorization to suspend concessions and other obligations pursuant to  Article 22.2 of the DSU (see below). At its meeting on 1 March 2001, pursuant  to Article 21.5 of the DSU, the DSB referred to the original panel the matter  raised by the United States and the matter raised by New Zealand (see DS113). Australia,  the European Communities and Mexico reserved their third party rights. On 12  April 2001, the compliance panel was composed.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 11 July 2001, the  compliance panel report was circulated to Members. The compliance panel  concluded that Canada, through the CEM scheme and the continued operation of  Special Milk Class 5(d), had acted inconsistently with its obligations under  Articles 3.3 and 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture, by providing export subsidies  within the meaning of Article 9.1(c) of the Agreement on Agriculture in excess  of its quantity commitment levels specified in its Schedule for exports of  cheese, for the marketing year 2000/2001.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 4 September 2001, Canada notified  the DSB of its decision to appeal certain issues of law covered in the  compliance panel report and certain legal interpretations developed by the  compliance panel. In particular, Canada appealed the compliance panel&rsquo;s finding  that the Canadian measures in question constitute an export subsidy within the  meaning of Article 9.1(c)of the Agreement on Agriculture. Canada considered  that the compliance panel&rsquo;s finding that commercial export sales constitute  payments that are financed by virtue of governmental action is based on  erroneous findings on issues of law and on related legal interpretations with  respect to the interpretation and application of the said Article 9.1(c).</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 3 December 2001, the  Appellate Body report was circulated to Members. The  Appellate Body reversed the compliance panel&rsquo;s findings to the effect that the  supply of CEM by domestic milk producers to domestic dairy processors involves  &ldquo;payments&rdquo; on the export of milk &ldquo;that are financed by virtue of governmental  action&rdquo; under Article 9.1(c) of the Agreement on Agriculture. The Appellate  Body concluded that, in the light of the factual findings made by the compliance  panel and the uncontested facts in the compliance panel record, it was unable  to complete the analysis of the claims made by New Zealand and the United  States under Articles 9.1(c) or 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture, or the  claim made by the United States under Article 3.1 of the SCM Agreement. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 18  December 2001, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the compliance panel  report, as reversed by the Appellate Body report.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3> Proceedings under  Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 16 February 2001, the United  States requested, simultaneously with its request for compliance proceedings  (see above), authorization from the DSB, pursuant to Article 22.2 DSU, to  suspend the application to Canada of tariff concessions and related obligations  under the GATT 1994, covering trade in the amount of USD&nbsp;35 million on an  annual basis or, if applicable, to an amount determined through arbitration  pursuant to Article 22.6 of the DSU to be equivalent to the nullification or  impairment of benefits accruing to the United States, given that, based on the  Understanding signed between Canada and the United States regarding procedures  under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU (see above), the United States understands  that Canada will object to the level of suspension of concessions requested  and/or make a claim under Article 22.3, thus referring the matter to  arbitration. On 28 February 2001, Canada objected to the level of suspension  and requested that the matter be referred to arbitration pursuant to Article  22.6 DSU. At its meeting on 1 March 2001, the DSB referred the matter to  arbitration.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Pursuant to the Additional Understanding  regarding procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU, the parties agreed to  request that the arbitration requested by Canada under Article 22.6 of the DSU  remain suspended pending the work of the second compliance panel (see below).</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 16 January 2003, the  parties informed the DSB that they had requested an extension of the suspension  of the Article 22.6 DSU arbitration until 7 February 2003, in order to permit  time for further consultations. On 6 February 2003, the parties informed the  DSB that they had agreed that the arbitration remain suspended until 10 April  2003. On 9 April 2003, the parties informed the DSB that they had agreed to  further suspend the arbitration until 9 May 2003.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Compliance proceedings (second recourse)</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 6 December 2001, the United  States requested, pursuant to Article 21.5 of the DSU, the establishment of a second  compliance panel . The United States considered that, since the Appellate  Body&rsquo;s compliance report did not make any findings on the consistency of  Canada&rsquo;s new measures, the United States continued to believe that Canada had  failed to comply with the original recommendations and rulings of the DSB. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 18  December 2001, the DSB agreed, pursuant to Article 21.5 of the DSU, to refer to  the original Panel, for the second time, the matter raised by the United States  and the matter raised by New Zealand (see DS113). The European Communities and  Australia reserved third-party rights. On 28 December 2001, Argentina reserved  its third-party rights.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 18 December 2001, Canada and  the United States notified the DSB of an Additional Understanding regarding  procedures under Article 21 and 22 of the DSU. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 17 January 2002, the compliance  panel was composed. On 26 July 2002, the compliance panel report was circulated  to Members. The compliance panel concluded that Canada, through the CEM scheme  and the continued operation of Special Milk Class 5(d), had acted  inconsistently with its obligations under Articles 3.3 and 8 of the Agreement  on Agriculture, by providing export subsidies within the meaning of Article  9.1(c) of the Agreement on Agriculture in excess of its quantity commitment  levels specified in its Schedule for exports of cheese and &ldquo;other dairy  products&rdquo;. It also concluded that Canada had acted inconsistently with its  obligations under Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture and that  therefore Canada had acted inconsistently with its obligations under Article 8  of the Agreement on Agriculture. Accordingly, the compliance panel recommended  that the DSB request Canada to bring its dairy products marketing regime into  conformity with its obligations in respect of export subsidies under the  Agreement on Agriculture.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 23 September 2002, Canada  notified the DSB of its decision to appeal certain issues of law and legal  interpretations developed by the compliance panel. On 20 December 2002, the  Appellate Body report was circulated to Members. The Appellate Body upheld the compliance  panel&rsquo;s finding that the measure at issue-the supply of &ldquo;commercial export  milk&rdquo; (&ldquo;CEM&rdquo;) by Canadian milk producers to Canadian dairy processors-involves  export subsidies in the form of &ldquo;payments&rdquo; on the export of milk that are  &ldquo;financed by virtue of governmental action&rdquo; within the meaning of Article  9.1(c) of the Agreement on Agriculture.  It reversed the compliance panel&rsquo;s interpretation of the rules on burden of  proof in Article 10.3 of the Agreement  on Agriculture. However, the Appellate Body held that this error did not  affect any of the compliance panel&rsquo;s other findings under the Agreement on Agriculture. In view of  its conclusion under Article 9.1(c) of the Agreement on Agriculture, the Appellate Body declined to rule on  the compliance panel&rsquo;s alternative finding under Article 10.1 of that  Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 17 January 2003, the DSB  adopted the Appellate Body report and the compliance panel report, as modified  by the Appellate Body report.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3> Mutually agreed solution</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 9 May 2003, Canada and  the United States informed the DSB that they had reached a mutually agreed  solution under Article 3.6 of the DSU.</p>
