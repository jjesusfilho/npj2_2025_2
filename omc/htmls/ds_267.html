      <h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Brazil. </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 27 September 2002 Brazil requested consultations  with the United States regarding prohibited and actionable subsidies provided  to US producers, users and/or exporters of upland cotton, as well as  legislation, regulations, statutory instruments and amendments thereto  providing such subsidies (including export credits), grants, and any other  assistance to the US producers, users and exporters of upland cotton (&ldquo;US  upland cotton industry&rdquo;).</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> Brazil contended that these measures were inconsistent  with the obligations of the United States under the following provisions:  Articles 5(c), 6.3(b), (c) and (d), 3.1(a) (including item (j) of the  Illustrative List of Export Subsidies in Annex I), 3.1(b), and 3.2 of the SCM  Agreement; Articles 3.3, 7.1, 8, 9.1 and 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture;  and Article III:4 of GATT 1994. Brazil  was of the view that the US  statutes, regulations, and administrative procedures listed above were inconsistent  with these provisions as such and as applied.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 9 October and 11 October 2002, Zimbabwe and India,  respectively, requested to join the consultations. On 14 October 2002, Argentina and Canada  requested to join the consultations. The United States informed the DSB that  it had accepted the requests of Argentina  and India  to join the consultations.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 6   February 2003, Brazil  requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 19 February 2003, the DSB deferred the  establishment of a panel. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> Further to a second request by Brazil, the DSB  established a Panel at its meeting on 18 March 2003. Argentina, Canada, China, Chinese  Taipei, the European Communities, India, Pakistan and Venezuela  reserved their third-party rights to participate in the Panel&rsquo;s proceedings. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> At that meeting, the Chairman of the DSB announced that  he continued to consult with Brazil  and the United States on the issue of appointing a DSB representative to  facilitate the information-gathering process, pursuant to the Annex V  procedures under the SCM Agreement, which had been invoked by Brazil in its  panel request. Following a communication from the United States, on 20&nbsp;March  2003, Brazil indicated, in conformity with paragraph 1 of Annex V, that it  considered the following third-county markets as relevant: Argentina,  Bangladesh, Colombia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Portugal, Philippines,  Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, Thailand and Turkey. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 24 March 2003, Benin reserved its third-party  rights. On 25 March 2003,  Australia  reserved its third-party rights. On 26 March 2003, Paraguay reserved its third-party  rights. On 28 March 2003,  New Zealand  reserved its third-party rights. On 4 April 2003, Chad reserved its third-party  rights. On 9 May 2003,  Brazil  requested the Director-General to compose the panel. On 19 May 2003, the Director-General  composed the panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 17   November 2003, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that it  would not be able to complete its work in six months due to the complexity of  the matter and that the panel expected to issue its final report to the parties  in May 2004.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 8   September 2004, the panel report was circulated to Members. The panel  found that:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li class="paranormaltext">agricultural export credit guarantees are  subject to WTO export subsidy disciplines and three United States export credit  guarantee programmes are prohibited export subsidies which have no Peace Clause  protection and are in violation of those disciplines;<br />
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li class="paranormaltext">the United States also grants several  other prohibited subsidies in respect of cotton;<br />
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li class="paranormaltext">United States&rsquo; domestic support programmes in  respect of cotton are not protected by the Peace Clause, and certain of these  programmes result in serious prejudice to Brazil&rsquo;s interests in the form of  price suppression in the world market. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 18   October 2004, the United    States notified its intention to appeal  certain issues of law and legal interpretations developed by the panel. On 16  December 2004, the Chairman of the Appellate Body informed the DSB that in  light of the numerous and complex issues raised in this dispute, the increased  burden on the Appellate Body as well as the translation services, the  intervening holiday period, and the fact that the Appellate Body expects to be  considering two or three other appeals in the coming weeks, the Appellate Body  would not be able to circulate its Report by, 17 December 2004. The Chairman  stated that the Appellate Body estimated that the Appellate Body report would  be circulated no later than 3 March 2005. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 3 March   2005, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members. The  Appellate Body found <em>inter alia</em> as follows:</p>

        <p class="paranormaltext">A. As  regards the applicability of the Peace  Clause to this dispute, the Appellate Body: </p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">        
      <li class="paranormaltext">upheld  the panel&rsquo;s finding that two challenged measures (production flexibility  contract and direct payments) are related to the <strong>type</strong> of production  undertaken after the base period and thus are <strong>not green box</strong> measures  conforming fully to paragraph 6(b) of Annex 2 to the Agreement on Agriculture; and, therefore, are not exempt, by  virtue of Article 13(a)(ii), from actions under Article XVI of GATT 1994 and  Part III of the SCM Agreement;<br />
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li class="paranormaltext">modified  the panel&rsquo;s interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;support to a specific commodity&rdquo; in  Article 13(b)(ii), but upheld the  Panel&rsquo;s conclusion that the challenged domestic support measures granted  support to upland cotton; and<br />
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li class="paranormaltext">upheld  the panel&rsquo;s finding that the challenged domestic support measures granted,  between 1999 and 2002, support to upland cotton <strong>in excess</strong> of that  decided during the 1992 benchmark period and, therefore, that these measures  are not exempt, by virtue of Article 13(b)(ii), from actions under Article  XVI:1 of the GATT 1994 and Part III of the SCM Agreement; <br />
&nbsp;        </li>
</ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">B. As  regards serious prejudice, the  Appellate Body: </p>
        <ul  class="paranormaltext">
        <li class="paranormaltext">upheld  the panel&rsquo;s finding that the effect of the challenged price-contingent  subsidies (marketing loan program payments, user marketing (Step 2) payments,  market loss assistance payments, and counter-cyclical payments) are significant  price suppression within the meaning of Article 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement, by in turn upholding the panel&rsquo;s findings  that: (i) the &ldquo;same market&rdquo; in Article 6.3(c) may be a &ldquo;world market&rdquo;, a &ldquo;world  market&rdquo; for upland cotton exists, and &ldquo;the A-Index can be taken to reflect a  world price in the world market for upland cotton&rdquo;; (ii) &ldquo;a causal link exists&rdquo;  between the price-contingent subsidies and significant price suppression, and  that this link is not attenuated by other factors raised by the United States;  (iii) it was not required to quantify precisely the benefit conferred on upland  cotton by the price-contingent subsidies; and (iv) the effect of the  price-contingent subsidies for marketing years 1999 to 2002 is significant  price suppression in the same period;<br />
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li class="paranormaltext">found  that the panel set out the findings of fact, the applicability of relevant  provisions, and the basic rationale behind this finding, as required by Article  12.7 of the DSU; and<br />
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li class="paranormaltext">found  it unnecessary to rule on the interpretation of the term &ldquo;world market share&rdquo;  in Article 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement  and <strong>neither upholds nor reverses</strong> the panel&rsquo;s finding that this term  means world <strong>supply</strong> share;</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">C. As  regards user marketing (Step 2)  payments, the Appellate Body: </p>
        <ul  class="paranormaltext">
        <li class="paranormaltext">upheld  the panel&rsquo;s findings that Step 2 payments to <strong>domestic users</strong> of United  States upland cotton, under Section 1207(a) of the FSRI Act of 2002, are  subsidies contingent on the use of domestic over imported goods that are  inconsistent with Articles 3.1(b) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement; and<br />
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li class="paranormaltext">uphelds  the Panel&rsquo;s findings that Step 2 payments to <strong>exporters</strong> of United States  upland cotton, pursuant to Section 1207(a) of the FSRI Act of 2002, are  subsidies contingent upon export performance within the meaning of Article  9.1(a) of the Agreement on Agriculture  that are inconsistent with Articles 3.3 and 8 of that Agreement and Articles  3.1(a) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement;</li>
</ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">D. As  regards export credit guarantee  programs, the Appellate Body: </p>
        <ul  class="paranormaltext">
        <li class="paranormaltext">in a <strong>majority</strong> opinion, upheld the panel&rsquo;s finding that  Article 10.2 of the Agreement on  Agriculture does <strong>not exempt</strong> export credit guarantees from the  export subsidy disciplines in Article 10.1 of that Agreement;<br />
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li class="paranormaltext">one Member of the Division, in a <strong>separate</strong> opinion, expressed the contrary view that Article 10.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture<strong> exempts</strong> export credit guarantees from the disciplines of Article 10.1 of that Agreement  until international disciplines are agreed upon;<br />
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li class="paranormaltext">found  that the panel did <strong>not</strong> improperly apply the <strong>burden of proof</strong> in  finding that the United States&rsquo; export credit guarantee programs are prohibited  export subsidies under Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement and are consequently inconsistent with Article 3.2  of that Agreement;<br />
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li class="paranormaltext">upheld  the panel&rsquo;s finding that &ldquo;the United States export credit guarantee programmes  at issue-GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP-constitute a <em>per se</em> export subsidy  within the meaning of item (j) of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies in  Annex I of the SCM Agreement&rdquo;,  and upheld the panel&rsquo;s findings  that these export credit guarantee programs are export subsidies for purposes  of Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement  and are inconsistent with Articles 3.1(a) and 3.2 of that Agreement; and<br />
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li class="paranormaltext">found  that the panel did <strong>not err</strong> in exercising <strong>judicial economy</strong> in  respect of Brazil&rsquo;s allegation that the United States&rsquo; export credit guarantee  programs are prohibited export subsidies, under Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement<em>,</em> because they  confer a &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; within the meaning of Article 1.1 of that Agreement; </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 21 March 2005, the DSB adopted the  Appellate Body report and the Panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body  report. The resulting DSB recommendations and rulings include the  recommendation that the United States withdraw, by at the latest within six  months of the date of adoption of the Panel report by the DSB or 1 July 2005  (whichever is earlier), the following prohibited subsidies: (i) the export  credit guarantees under the GSM 102, GSM 103 and SCGP export credit guarantee  programmes in respect of exports of upland cotton and other unscheduled agricultural  products supported under the programmes, and in respect of one scheduled  product (rice); (ii) Section 1207(a) of the Farm Security and Rural Investment  (FSRI) Act of 2002 providing for user marketing (STEP2) payments to exporters  of upland cotton; and (iii) Section 1207(a) of the FSRI Act of 2002 providing  for user marketing (STEP2) payments to domestic users of upland cotton. As for  the actionable subsidies the recommendation is that the United States takes  appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects of certain subsidies or  withdraw these subsidies within six months from the date of adoption of the  Panel and Appellate Body reports, i.e. the compliance period expired on 21  September 2005.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Compliance proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> Following the suspension of the arbitration proceedings  under Article 22.6 triggered by Brazil's request to take countermeasures with  respect to the prohibited and actionable subsidies (see below), on 18 August  2006, Brazil requested the establishment of a compliance panel. At its meeting  on 1 September 2006,  the DSB deferred the establishment of a compliance panel. Further to a second  request, at its meeting on 28   September 2006, the DSB agreed, if possible, to refer the matter  raised by Brazil  to the original panel. Argentina,  Australia,  Canada,  China,  the European Communities, India,  Japan  and New Zealand  reserved their third party rights. Subsequently, Chad and Thailand reserved their third party  rights. On 18 and 20   October 2006, Brazil  and the United States  respectively requested the Director-General to compose the compliance panel. On  25&nbsp;October 2006, the Director-General composed the panel. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 9   January 2007, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that given  the particular circumstances of this case and the schedule adopted after consultations  with parties to this dispute, it had not been possible for the panel to  complete its work within the 90-day period as foreseen in Article 21.5. The panel  expected to complete its work in July 2007. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 18   December 2007, the compliance panel report was circulated to  Members. The Panel found that with respect to the measure taken by the United States  to comply with the DSB recommendations and rulings relating to the original  panel's finding of inconsistency with Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li class="paranormaltext">The United States acted inconsistently with its  obligations under Articles 5(c) and 6.3(c) of the SCM  Agreement in that the effect of marketing loan and counter-cyclical payments  provided to US upland cotton producers pursuant to the FSRI Act of 2002 is  significant price suppression within the meaning of Article 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement in the world market for upland cotton  constituting &ldquo;present&rdquo; serious prejudice to the interests of Brazil within the  meaning of Article 5(c) of the SCM  Agreement.&nbsp; By acting inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;5(c) and 6.3(c) of  the SCM Agreement the United States  had failed to comply with the DSB recommendations and rulings.&nbsp;  Specifically, the United    States had failed to comply with its  obligation under Article 7.8 of the SCM  Agreement &ldquo;to take appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or ...  withdraw the subsidy&rdquo;. <br />
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li class="paranormaltext">Brazil had not made a <em>prima facie</em> case that the effect of marketing loan and  counter-cyclical payments provided to US upland cotton producers pursuant to the  FSRI Act of 2002 is an increase in the US world market share in upland cotton  as compared to the average US world market share during the previous period of  three years and that this increase follows a consistent trend over a period  when subsidies have been granted.&nbsp; Therefore, it had not been established  that the United States  acted inconsistently with Articles 5(c) and 6.3(d) of the SCM Agreement. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">With respect to the measure taken by the United States  to comply with the DSB recommendations and rulings relating to the original  panel's findings of inconsistency with Articles 10.1 and 8 of the Agreement on  Agriculture and Articles 3.1(a) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement, the panel found: </p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li class="paranormaltext">Regarding GSM 102 export credit guarantees  issued after 1 July 2005 the United&nbsp;States acted inconsistently with  Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture by applying export subsidies in a  manner which results in the circumvention of US export subsidy commitments with  respect to certain unscheduled products and certain scheduled products, and as  a result acted inconsistently with Article 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture.  Regarding GSM&nbsp;102 export credit guarantees issued after 1 July 2005, the  United States also acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1(a) and 3.2 of the SCM  Agreement by providing export subsidies to unscheduled products and by  providing export subsidies to scheduled products in excess of the commitments  of the United States  under the Agreement on Agriculture. By acting inconsistently with Articles 10.1  and 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture and Articles&nbsp;3.1(a) and 3.2 of the  SCM Agreement, the United    States had failed to comply with the DSB  recommendations and rulings. Specifically, the United States had failed to bring  its measures into conformity with the Agreement on Agriculture and had failed  &ldquo;to withdraw the subsidy without delay&rdquo;. <br />
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li class="paranormaltext">With respect to certain export credits  guarantees issued prior to 1   July 2005, Brazil  had not established that the United    States had failed to &ldquo;withdraw the subsidy  without delay&rdquo;. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">The panel also considered that to the extent that the  measures taken by the United    States to comply with the recommendations  and rulings adopted by the DSB in the original proceeding were inconsistent  with the objections of the United    States under the covered agreements, these  recommendations and rulings remain operative.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 12   February 2008, the United    States notified its decision to appeal to  the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the compliance panel report  and certain legal interpretations developed by the panel. On 25 February 2008, Brazil notified  its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law and legal  interpretations in the compliance panel report. On 11&nbsp;April 2008, the  Chairman of the Appellate Body informed the DSB that it would not be possible  to circulate its report within 60 days in light of the numerous and complex  issues raised in this appeal, and the increased burden on translation services.  It estimated that the Appellate Body report would be issued no later than 2  June 2008.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 2   June 2008, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> As regards the scope of the Article 21.5 proceedings,  the Appellate Body upheld the Panel's finding that Brazil's claims relating to export  credit guarantees for pig meat and poultry meat are properly within the scope  of these Article 21.5 proceedings. Because the condition on which it was  predicated had not been fulfilled, the Appellate Body did not find it necessary  to consider Brazil's  other appeal that the Panel erred when it found that the measure that is the  subject of Brazil's  claims is not the revised GSM 102 programme itself. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body also upheld the Panel's finding that  Brazil's  claims against marketing loan and counter-cyclical payments made by the United States  after 21 September 2005  were properly within the scope of these Article 21.5 proceedings. Because the  condition on which it was predicated has not been fulfilled, the Appellate Body  did not find it necessary to consider Brazil's other appeal that the Panel  erred in finding that the original panel's conclusions and recommendations  addressed only the payments made under the marketing loan and counter-cyclical  payments programmes, and not the programmes themselves. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> As regards the revised GSM 102 export credit guarantee  programme, the Appellate Body found that the Panel failed to make an objective  assessment of the matter, under Article 11 of the DSU, because it dismissed the  import of the re-estimates data submitted by the United States on the basis of  internally inconsistent reasoning. Consequently, the Appellate Body reversed  the Panel's intermediate finding that &ldquo;the initial subsidy estimates provide a  strong indication that GSM 102 export credit guarantees are provided against  premia which are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses  of the GSM 102 programme&rdquo;. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body upheld the Panel's finding that &ldquo;the  GSM&nbsp;102 programme is not designed to cover its long term operating costs  and losses&rdquo; and, albeit for reasons that differ from those of the Panel, the  Panel's conclusion that &ldquo;the GSM 102 export credit guarantee programme  constitutes an 'export subsidy' because it is provided against premiums which  are inadequate to cover its long term operating costs and losses under the  terms of item (j) of the Illustrative List&rdquo;. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> Consequently, the Appellate Body upheld the Panel's  finding that GSM 102 export credit guarantees issued after 1 July 2005 are  export subsidies within the meaning of Article&nbsp;3.1(a) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement  and Article 10.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture; and that regarding export  credit guarantees issued under the revised GSM 102 programme after 1 July 2005  the United&nbsp;States acts inconsistently with Article 10.1 of the Agreement  on Agriculture by applying export subsidies in a manner which results in the  circumvention of United States' export subsidy commitments with respect to  certain unscheduled products and certain scheduled products, and as a result  acts inconsistently with Article 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture. Regarding  export credit guarantees issued under the revised GSM 102 programme after 1  July 2005, the Appellate Body also found that the United States also acts  inconsistently with Articles 3.1(a) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement by providing  export subsidies to unscheduled products and by providing export subsidies to  scheduled products in excess of the commitments of the United States under the  Agreement on Agriculture. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body further found that, by acting  inconsistently with Articles 10.1 and 8 of the Agreement on Agriculture and  Articles 3.1(a) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement, the United States had failed to  comply with the DSB recommendations and rulings and specifically, had failed to  bring its measures into conformity with the Agreement on Agriculture and &ldquo;to  withdraw the subsidy without delay&rdquo;. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> As regards whether the effect of marketing loan and  counter-cyclical payments is significant price suppression, the Appellate Body  upheld the panel's findings that the United States acted inconsistently with  its obligations under Articles&nbsp;5(c) and&nbsp;6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement  in that the effect of marketing loan and counter-cyclical payments provided to  United States upland cotton producers pursuant to the FSRI Act of 2002 is  significant price suppression, within the meaning of Article 6.3(c) of the SCM  Agreement, in the world market for upland cotton, constituting &ldquo;present&rdquo;  serious prejudice to the interests of Brazil within the meaning of Article 5(c)  of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. The Appellate Body also found that, by acting  inconsistently with Articles 5(c) and 6.3(c) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement, the  United States had failed to comply with the DSB's recommendations and rulings  and, specifically, failed to comply with its obligation under Article&nbsp;7.8  of the SCM Agreement &ldquo;to take appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects  or ... withdraw the subsidy&rdquo;. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body further found that the Panel did not  fail to make an objective assessment of the matter before it, as required by  Article 11 of the DSU, in its analysis of Brazil's claim that the effect of  the marketing loan and counter-cyclical payments is significant price  suppression. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body recommended that the DSB request the  United States  to bring its measures, found to be inconsistent with the Agreement on  Agriculture and the SCM Agreement, into conformity with its obligations under  those Agreements. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on&nbsp;20 June 2008, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body  report and the Panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body report. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Proceedings under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 4 July 2005, prior to the initiation of the  compliance proceedings (see above), and in respect of the &ldquo;prohibited  subsidies&rdquo;, Brazil requested,&nbsp; the  DSB for authorization to take appropriate countermeasures pursuant to Article  4.10 of the SCM Agreement and to suspend concessions or other obligations  pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU.&nbsp;  Brazil asserted that &nbsp;the  reasonable period of time had expired on 1 July 2005.&nbsp; Brazil stated it intended to take appropriate  countermeasures in the form of the suspension of tariff concessions and related  obligations under the GATT 1994 by imposing additional customs duties on a list  of products imported from the United States, to be defined by Brazil. In  addition, given that it considered that it was not practicable or effective to  exclusively apply additional import duties and that it considered that the  circumstances were serious enough, Brazil stated it may resort, to the extent  necessary, to countermeasures in the form of suspension of certain obligations  under &nbsp;the Agreement on Trade-Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) and the General  Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> With regard to the prohibited subsidies, on 5 July 2005  the parties to the dispute jointly notified the DSB of &ldquo;Agreed Procedures under  Articles 21 and 22 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding and Article 4 of the  SCM Agreement&rdquo;.&nbsp; On 14 July 2005, the  United States submitted its objections to the request for authorization by  Brazil pursuant to Article 22.6 of the DSU and Article 4.11 of the SCM  Agreement challenging the appropriateness of the countermeasures, the proposed  level of suspension and asserting that the principles and procedures set forth  in Article 22.3 of the DSU had not been followed.&nbsp; At its meeting on 15 July 2005, the DSB  referred the matter raised by the United States to arbitration. On 17 August  2005, the parties to the dispute jointly requested the Chairman of the  Arbitrator to suspend the Article 22.6 arbitration proceedings in accordance  with the Agreed Procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU, and the  Arbitrator suspended the proceedings accordingly.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 6 October 2005, in respect of the &ldquo;actionable  subsidies&rdquo; Brazil requested the DSB for authorization to suspend  concessions or other obligations under Article 7.9 of the SCM Agreement and  Article 22.2 of the DSU. &nbsp;Brazil asserted  that the reasonable period of time had expired on 21&nbsp;September 2005.&nbsp; Brazil stated that in principle, these countermeasures  would take the form of suspension of tariff concessions and related obligations  under the GATT 1994 by means of the imposition of additional import duties on a  list of products imported from the United States, to be defined by Brazil. In  addition, Brazil contended that it was not practicable or effective to suspend  concessions or other obligations exclusively with respect to the same  sector/agreement as that in which the Panel and the Appellate Body have found  the violations and that the circumstances are serious enough to justify the  suspension of concessions or obligations under other covered agreements.  Therefore it affirmed it may, to the extent necessary, resort to  countermeasures in the form of suspension of certain obligations under the TRIPS  Agreement and the GATS. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 17 October 2005, the United States submitted its  objections to the request for authorization by Brazil pursuant to Article 22.6  of the DSU and Article 7.10 of the SCM Agreement arguing that the  countermeasures proposed are not commensurate with the degree and nature of the  adverse effects determined to exist within the meaning of Article 7.9 of the  SCM Agreement and that the level of suspension proposed is not equivalent to  the level of nullification or impairment within the meaning of Article 22.7 of  the DSU. With respect to Brazil's request for &ldquo;cross-retaliation&rdquo;,  the United States claimed that the principles and procedures set forth in  Article 22.3 of the DSU have not been followed. At its meeting on 18 October  2005, the DSB referred the matter raised by the United States to  arbitration.&nbsp; On 21 November 2005, the  parties to the dispute jointly requested the Chairman of the Arbitrator to  suspend the Article 22.6 arbitration proceedings in accordance with the Agreed  Procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU, and the Arbitrator suspended  the proceedings accordingly. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 25 August 2008, and following the completion of the  compliance proceedings (see above), Brazil requested that the two arbitration  proceedings be resumed.&nbsp; At the time that  Brazil requested the resumption of the arbitration proceedings, two of the  arbitrators had become unavailable to serve in these proceedings.&nbsp; On 1 October 2008, the parties agreed to the  replacement arbitrators. On 31&nbsp;August 2009, the two Decisions by the  Arbitrator were circulated to Members.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> With respect to the &ldquo;prohibited subsidies&rdquo; at  issue, the Arbitrator determined that Brazil may request authorization from the  DSB to suspend concessions or other obligations under the Agreements on trade  in goods in Annex 1A, at a level not to exceed the value of USD&nbsp;147.4  million for FY 2006, or, for subsequent years, an annual amount to be  determined by applying a methodology described in the Decision of the  Arbitrator. The Arbitrator also determined that, in the event that the total  level of countermeasures that Brazil would be entitled to in a given year  should increase to a level that would exceed a threshold described in the  decisions, updated to account for the change in Brazil's total imports from the  United States, then, Brazil would also be entitled to seek to suspend certain  obligations under the TRIPS Agreement and/or the GATS with respect to any  amount of permissible countermeasures applied in excess of that figure.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> With respect to the &ldquo;actionable subsidies&rdquo; at  issue, the Arbitrator determined that Brazil may request authorization from the  DSB to suspend concessions or other obligations under the Agreements on trade  in goods in Annex 1A, at a level not to exceed the value of USD&nbsp;147.3  million annually. The Arbitrator also determined that, in the event that the  total level of countermeasures that Brazil would be entitled to in a given year  should increase to a level that would exceed a threshold described in the  decisions, updated to account for the change in Brazil's total imports from the  United States, then, Brazil would also be entitled to seek to suspend certain  obligations under the TRIPS Agreement and/or the GATS with respect to any  amount of permissible countermeasures applied in excess of that figure.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> With respect to the &ldquo;prohibited subsidies&rdquo;,  on 6 November 2009, Brazil requested authorization from the DSB to suspend the  application to the United States of concessions or other obligations in  conformity with the Arbitrators' Decision pursuant to Article 22.7 of the DSU  and Article 4.10 of the SCM Agreement. At its meeting on 19 November 2009, the  DSB authorized Brazil to suspend the application to the United States of  concessions or other obligations.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> With respect to the &ldquo;actionable subsidies&rdquo;, on  6 November 2009, Brazil requested authorization from the DSB to suspend the  application to the United States of concessions or other obligations in  conformity with the Arbitrators' Decision pursuant to Article 22.7 of the DSU  and Article 7.9 of the SCM agreement.&nbsp; At  its meeting on 19 November 2009, the DSB authorized Brazil to suspend the  application to the United States of concessions or other obligations.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 8 March 2010, Brazil notified the DSB that, starting  on 7 April 2010, it would suspend the application to the United&nbsp;States of  concessions or other obligations under the GATT 1994 in the form of increased  import duties on certain products when they are imported from the United  States. However on 30 April 2010, Brazil notified the DSB that it had decided  to postpone the imposition of countermeasures vis-&agrave;-vis the United States  indicating that no countermeasures would enter into force before 21 June 2010,  since Brazil and the United States were engaged in a dialogue with a view to  reaching a mutually satisfactory solution to the dispute.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On  25 August 2010, Brazil and the United States notified the DSB they had concluded  a <strong>Framework for a Mutually Agreed  Solution to the Cotton Dispute</strong> (<strong>Framework</strong>)  which in itself does not constitute a mutually agreed solution to the dispute  but sets out parameters for discussions on a solution with respect to domestic  support programs for upland cotton in the United&nbsp;States, as well as a  process of joint operation reviews as regards export credit guarantees under  the program GSM-102. Brazil and the United States also agreed to hold  consultations not less than four times a year, unless they agree otherwise,  with the aim of obtaining convergence of views in respect of a solution to the Cotton  dispute. The <strong>Framework</strong> also provides  that, upon enactment of successor legislation to the <strong>US Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008</strong>, Brazil and the United  States will consult with a view to determining whether a mutually agreed  solution to the Cotton dispute has been reached. The joint communication also  specified that as long as the <strong>Framework</strong> is in effect, Brazil will not impose the countermeasures authorized by the DSB.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">At  the DSB meeting on 23 October 2012, Brazil said that on 30 September 2012, the  2008 US Farm Bill had expired without the enactment of a successor  legislation.&nbsp; However,  taking into account that the current US agricultural support programs remained  unchanged, Brazil had decided not to terminate the Memorandum of Understanding  and the Framework Agreement and would thus not impose any countermeasures at  this time.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 16  October 2014, Brazil and the United States notified the DSB that, in  accordance with Article&nbsp;3.6 of the DSU, they had concluded a  Memorandum of Understanding, and  agreed that this dispute was terminated. As a result, no  suspension of concessions or other obligations pursuant to the authorization  previously granted by the DSB shall be applied and no further action shall be  taken under Article 21.5 of the DSU based on a disagreement as  to the existence or consistency of any measure taken to comply with the DSB  recommendations and rulings.</p>
