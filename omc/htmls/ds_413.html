        <h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by  the United States. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 15  September 2010, the United States requested consultations with China with  respect to &ldquo;certain restrictions and requirements maintained by China  pertaining to electronic payment services for payment card transactions and the  suppliers of those services&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The  United States alleged that China permits only a Chinese entity (China UnionPay)  to supply electronic payment services for payment card transactions denominated  and paid in renminbi in China.&nbsp; Service  suppliers of other Members can only supply these services for payment card  transactions paid in foreign currency.&nbsp; China also requires  all payment card processing devices to be compatible with that entity's system,  and that payment cards must bear that company's logo.&nbsp; It further argued that the Chinese entity has  guaranteed access to all merchants in China that accept payment cards, while services  suppliers of other Members must negotiate for access to merchants.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">The United  States alleged that China appears to be acting inconsistently with its  obligations under Articles XVI and XVII of the GATS.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 11   February 2011, the United    States requested the establishment of a panel.&nbsp; At its meeting on 24&nbsp;February 2011, the DSB deferred the  establishment of a panel. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 25 March 2011, the DSB established a panel.&nbsp; Australia, the European Union, Guatemala, Japan and Korea reserved  their third party rights. Subsequently, Ecuador and India reserved their third  party rights.&nbsp; On 23 June  2011, the United States requested the Director-General to determine the  composition of the panel.&nbsp; On 4 July  2011, the Director-General composed the panel. On 9&nbsp;January  2012, the Chairman of the panel notified  the DSB that it would not be able to issue its report within six months. &nbsp;The timetable adopted by  the panel after consultations with the parties to the dispute envisages that  the final report shall be issued to the parties by May 2012. &nbsp;The panel expects to conclude its work within  that time-frame.</p>
          <p class="paranormaltext"><a name="bkmk413r" id="bkmk413r"></a>On 16  July 2012, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p class="paranormaltext">This dispute concerns various alleged Chinese  requirements that the United States claimed are inconsistent with obligations China allegedly assumed under  the GATS.&nbsp; These are:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <ul class="paranormaltext">
              <li class="paranormaltext">Alleged requirements that establish China  UnionPay (CUP), a Chinese company, as the sole supplier of electronic payment  services (EPS) for all domestic Renminbi (RMB) payment card transactions; <br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li class="paranormaltext">Alleged requirements  that payment cards issued by banks in China bear the &ldquo;Yin Lian&rdquo;/&ldquo;UnionPay&rdquo; logo (the logo of CUP's  network);<br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li class="paranormaltext">Alleged requirements  that all ATMs, merchant card processing equipment and point-of-sale terminals  in China be capable of accepting payment cards bearing the &ldquo;Yin Lian&rdquo;/&ldquo;UnionPay&rdquo;  logo;<br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li class="paranormaltext">Alleged requirements  that acquiring institutions post the &ldquo;Yin  Lian&rdquo;/&ldquo;UnionPay&rdquo; logo and be capable of accepting all  payment cards bearing the &ldquo;Yin Lian&rdquo;/&ldquo;UnionPay&rdquo;  logo; <br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li class="paranormaltext">Alleged prohibitions  on the use of non-CUP cards for inter-bank and cross-region payment card  transactions; and <br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li class="paranormaltext">Alleged requirements  pertaining to RMB transactions involving payment cards issued in China and used  in Hong Kong, China or Macao, China, and payment cards issued in Hong Kong,  China or Macao, China and used in China.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The United States claimed that China assumed  market access and national treatment commitments to permit the supply of EPS  both on a cross-border basis (under mode 1) and through commercial presence  (under mode 3).&nbsp; The United States  considered that EPS fall under subsector 7.B(d) of China's GATS Schedule, which  reads &ldquo;[a]ll payment and money transmission services, including credit,  charge, and debit cards, travellers cheques and bankers drafts (including  import and export settlement)&rdquo;.&nbsp; The  United States further claimed that, in view of these alleged commitments, the  identified Chinese requirements are inconsistent with China's market access and  national treatment obligations under Articles XVI and XVII of the GATS.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The panel first examined whether the services  at issue &mdash; EPS for payment card transactions &mdash; are covered under subsector  7.B(d) of China's GATS Schedule and decided in the affirmative.&nbsp; The panel rejected the United States' view that China's Schedule  includes a market access commitment concerning subsector 7.B(d) to allow the  cross-border (Mode 1) supply of EPS into China by foreign EPS suppliers.&nbsp; However, the panel found that China's  Schedule includes a market access commitment that allows foreign EPS suppliers  to supply their services through commercial presence in China, so long as a  supplier meets certain qualifications requirements related to local (RMB)  currency business.&nbsp; In addition, the  panel concluded that China's Schedule contains a full national treatment  commitment for the cross-border (Mode 1) supply of EPS, as well as a national  treatment commitment under mode 3 that is also subject to certain  qualifications requirements related to local (RMB) currency business.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The panel next considered whether the various  requirements alleged by the United States actually exist.&nbsp; The panel rejected the United States' claim  on the basis of insufficient evidence that China maintains CUP as an  across-the-board monopoly supplier for the processing of all domestic RMB  payment card transactions.&nbsp; Accordingly,  the panel rejected the United States' market access and national treatment  claims in their entirety in respect of this alleged across-the-board  requirement.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> However, the panel concluded that China  maintains CUP as a monopoly supplier for the clearing of certain types of  RMB-denominated payment card transactions.&nbsp;  The specific transactions in respect of which the panel determined that  CUP is a sole supplier involve RMB payment cards issued in China and used in  Hong Kong, China or Macao, China, or RMB payment cards issued in Hong Kong,  China or Macao, China and used in China.&nbsp;  Article XVI:2(a) requires Members not to limit the number of service  suppliers where market access commitments have been undertaken.&nbsp; The panel found that China acted  inconsistently with its mode 3 market access commitment under Article&nbsp;XVI:2(a)  of the GATS by granting CUP a monopoly for the clearing of these types of RMB  payment card transactions.&nbsp; The panel  found no inconsistency with China's national treatment commitments.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> Regarding the other Chinese requirements at  issue, the panel found that China maintains a requirement that all payment cards issued in China must  bear the &ldquo;Yin Lian&rdquo;/&ldquo;UnionPay&rdquo;  logo and be interoperable with that network, a requirement that all terminal  equipment in China must be capable of accepting &ldquo;Yin Lian&rdquo;/&ldquo;UnionPay&rdquo; logo cards, and finally, a  requirement that acquiring institutions post the &ldquo;Yin Lian&rdquo;/&ldquo;UnionPay&rdquo; logo and be capable of accepting  all payment cards bearing the &ldquo;Yin  Lian&rdquo;/&ldquo;UnionPay&rdquo; logo.&nbsp;  The panel found each of these requirements to be inconsistent with  China's mode 1 and mode 3 national treatment obligations under Article XVII of  the GATS.&nbsp; It found, through these  requirements, that China modifies the conditions of competition in favour of  CUP and therefore fails to provide national treatment to EPS suppliers of other  Members, contrary to China's commitments.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 31 August 2012, the DSB adopted the panel report.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">At the DSB meeting on 28 September  2012, China  stated that it intended to implement the DSB's  recommendations and ruling in a manner that respects its WTO obligations. China  added that it would need a reasonable period of  time to do so. On 22 November 2012, China and the United&nbsp;States  informed the DSB that they had agreed that the reasonable period of time for  China to implement the DSB's recommendations and ruling shall be 11 months from  the date of adoption of the panel report. &nbsp;Accordingly, the reasonable period of time  expired on 31 July 2013. At the DSB meeting on 23 July 2013, China reported  that it had fully implemented the DSB's recommendations and rulings. &nbsp;The United States said that it did not agree  with China's assertion that it had complied. The United States stated that it would  monitor and review China's actions.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 19 August 2013, China and the United States  informed the DSB of Agreed Procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU.</p>
