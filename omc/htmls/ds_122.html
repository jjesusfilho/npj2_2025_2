		<h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Poland. </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 6 April
      1998, Poland requested consultations with Thailand concerning the
      imposition of final anti-dumping duties on imports of angles, shapes and
      sections of iron or non-alloy steel and H-beams. Poland asserted that
      provisional anti-dumping duties were imposed by Thailand on 27 December
      1996, and a final anti-dumping duty of 27.78% of CIF value for these
      products, produced or exported by any Polish producer or exporter, was
      imposed on 26 May 1997. Poland further asserted that Thailand refused two
      requests by Poland for disclosure of findings. Poland contended that these
      actions by Thailand violate Articles 2, 3, 5 and 6 of the Anti-Dumping
      Agreement.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 13 October 1999, Poland
      requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 27 October 1999,
      the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Further to a second request
        to establish a panel by Poland, the DSB established a panel at its meeting
        on 19 November 1999. The EC, Japan and the US reserved their third-party
        rights. On 20 December 1999, the Panel was composed. The report was
        circulated to Members on 28 September 2000. The Panel concluded that:</p>
      <ol class="paranormaltext" type="i">
        <li>
          Poland failed to establish that Thailand had acted
          inconsistently with its obligations under Article 2 of the
          Anti-Dumping Agreement or Article VI of the GATT 1994 in the
          calculation of the amount for profit in constructing normal value.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>

        <li>
          Thailand’s imposition of the definitive
          anti-dumping measure on imports of H-beams from Poland was
          inconsistent with the requirements of Article 3 of the Anti-Dumping
          Agreement in that:</li>
      </ol>

      

      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>
          inconsistently with the second sentence of Article
          3.2 and Article 3.1, the Thai authorities did not consider, on the
          basis of an “objective examination” of “positive
          evidence” in the disclosed factual basis, the price effects of
          dumped imports;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          inconsistently with Articles 3.4 and 3.1, the Thai
          investigating authorities failed to consider certain factors listed in
          Article 3.4, and failed to provide an adequate explanation of how the
          determination of injury could be reached on the basis of an “unbiased or objective evaluation” or an
          “objective
          examination” of “positive evidence” in the disclosed
          factual basis; and<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>inconsistently with Articles 3.5 and 3.1, the
          Thai authorities made a determination of a causal relationship between
          dumped imports and any possible injury on the basis of (a) their
          findings concerning the price effects of dumped imports, which the
          Panel had already found to be inconsistent with the second sentence of
          Article 3.2 and Article 3.1; and (b) their findings concerning injury,
          which the Panel had already found to be inconsistent with Article 3.4
          and 3.1.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ol class="paranormaltext" type="i" start="3">
      <li>under Article 3.8 of the DSU, in cases where
      there is infringement of the obligations assumed under a covered
      agreement, the action is considered <i>prima facie</i> to constitute a
      case of nullification or impairment of benefits under that agreement, and
      that, accordingly, to the extent Thailand has acted inconsistently with
      the provisions of the AD Agreement, it has nullified or impaired benefits
      accruing to Poland under that Agreement.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 23 October 2000, Thailand notified the DSB of its
      decision to appeal certain issues of law covered in the Panel Report and
      legal interpretations developed by the Panel. The Appellate Body
      circulated its report on 12 March 2001. The Appellate Body:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>
          upheld the Panel’s conclusion that with respect to the
      claims under Articles 2, 3 and 5 of the AD Agreement, the request for the
      establishment of a panel submitted by Poland in this case was sufficient
      to meet the requirements of Article 6.2 of the DSU;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          reversed the finding of the Panel that the AD Agreement
      requires a panel reviewing the imposition of an anti-dumping duty to
      consider only the facts, evidence and reasoning that were disclosed to, or
      discernible by, Polish firms at the time of the final determination of
      dumping. The Appellate Body was of the view that there was no basis for
      the Panel’s reasoning, either in Article 3.1 of the AD Agreement, which
      lays down the obligations of Members with respect to the determination of
      injury, or in Article 17.6 of the AD Agreement, which sets out the
      standard of review for panels.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          Although having reversed the reasoning of the Panel on
      this issue, it left undisturbed the Panel’s main findings of violation;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          upheld the Panel’s conclusion under Article 3.4 of the
      AD Agreement. The Appellate Body agreed with the Panel that Article 3.4
      requires a mandatory evaluation of all the factors listed in that
      provision,<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          concluded that the Panel did not err in its application
      of the burden of proof, or in the application of the standard of review
      under Article 17.6(i) of the AD Agreement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting of 5 April 2001, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body
      report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body report.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>

		<h3>Implementation  of adopted reports</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> Thailand informed the DSB that it
      was in the process of identifying the most suitable way to comply with the
      DSB’s recommendations in this case and that it would need a reasonable
      period of time for implementation. Poland reiterated its position that in
      order to implement the DSB’s recommendations in this case Thailand would
      have to revoke the duties currently in place. If not, Poland would seek
      recourse to Article 21.5 of the DSU. Poland was ready to enter into
      consultations with Thailand on a reasonable period of time for
      implementation. On 25 May 2001, the parties to the dispute informed the
      DSB that they had agreed that the reasonable period of time shall be 6
      months and 15 days and therefore expired on 20 October 2001.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">At the DSB meeting on 18 December 2001, Thailand
      announced that it had fully implemented the DSB’s recommendations. Poland
      said that it could not accept the way in which Thailand had implemented
      the DSB’s recommendations because it expected that the measures in
      question would be either rescinded or modified. In Poland’s view, Thailand
      only changed the justification for the imposition of the measures. Poland
      reserved its rights under Article 21.5 of the DSU.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 18 December 2001, Thailand and Poland concluded an understanding
      with regard to possible proceedings under Article 21 and 22 of the DSU.
      Pursuant to the understanding, in the event that Poland initiates
      proceedings under Articles 21.5 and 22 of the DSU, Poland agrees to
      initiate complete proceedings under 21.5 prior to any proceedings under
      Article 22. On 21 January 2002, the parties informed the DSB that they
      have reached an agreement to the effect that the implementation of the
      recommendations of the DSB in this dispute should no longer remain on the
      agenda of the DSB.</p>
