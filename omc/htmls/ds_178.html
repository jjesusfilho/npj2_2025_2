		<h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Australia. </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 16 July 1999, New Zealand requested consultations
      with the US in respect of a safeguard measure imposed by the US on imports
      of lamb meat from New Zealand (WT/DS177). New Zealand alleged that by
      Presidential Proclamation under Section 203 of the US Trade Act 1974, the
      US imposed a definitive safeguard measure in the form of a tariff-rate
      quota on imports fresh, chilled, or frozen lamb meat effective from 22
      July 1999. New Zealand contended that this measure is inconsistent with
      Articles 2, 4, 5, 11 and 12 of the Agreement on Safeguards, and Articles I
      and XIX of GATT 1994.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 23 July 1999, Australia requested consultations with
      the US in respect of a definitive safeguard measure imposed by the US on
      imports of lamb (WT/DS178). Australia alleged that by Presidential
      Proclamation under Section 203 of the US Trade Act 1974, the US imposed a
      definitive safeguard measure in the form of a tariff-rate quota on imports
      of fresh, chilled, or frozen lamb meat from Australia effective from 22
      July 1999. Australia contended that this measure is inconsistent with
      Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11 and 12 of the Agreement on Safeguards, and
      Articles I, II and XIX of GATT 1994.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 14 October 1999, New Zealand and Australia requested
      the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 27 October 1999, the DSB
      deferred the establishment of the panels. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Further to the second requests
        to establish a panel by New Zealand and Australia, at its meeting on 19
        November 1999, the DSB established, pursuant to Article 9.1 of the DSU, a
        single panel to examine the complaints WT/DS177 and WT/DS178. Canada, the
        EC, Iceland and Japan reserved their third-party rights. Australia
        reserved its third-party rights in relation to the complaint by New
        Zealand, while New Zealand reserved its third-party rights in relation to
        the complaint by Australia. On 21 March 2000, the Panel was composed. The
        Panel circulated its report on 21 December 2000. The Panel concluded that:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>the US has acted inconsistently with Article XIX:1(a)
      of GATT 1994 by failing to demonstrate as a matter of fact the existence
      of “unforeseen developments”;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the US has acted inconsistently with Article 4.1(c) of
      the Agreement on Safeguards because the USITC, in the lamb meat
      investigation, defined the domestic industry as including input producers
      as producers of the like product at issue (i.e. lamb meat);<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the complainants failed to establish that the USITC’s
      analytical approach to determining the existence of a threat of serious
      injury, in particular with respect to the prospective analysis and the
      time-period used, is inconsistent with Article 4.1(b) of the Agreement on
      Safeguards;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the complainants failed to establish that the USITC’s
      analytical approach to evaluating all of the factors listed in Article
      4.2(a) of the Agreement on Safeguards when determining whether increased
      imports threatened to cause serious injury with respect to the domestic
      industry as defined in the investigation is inconsistent with that
      provision;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the US has acted inconsistently with Article 4.1(c) of
      the Agreement on Safeguards because the USITC failed to obtain data in
      respect of producers representing a major proportion of the total domestic
      production by the domestic industry as defined in the investigation;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the US has acted inconsistently with Article 4.2(b) of
      the Agreement on Safeguards because the USITC’s determination in the lamb
      meat investigation in respect of causation did not demonstrate the
      required causal link between increased imports and threat of serious
      injury, in that the determination did not establish that increased imports
      were by themselves a necessary and sufficient cause of threat of serious
      injury, and in that the determination did not ensure that threat of
      serious injury caused by “other factors” was not attributed to
      increased imports;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>by virtue of the above violations of Article 4 of the
      Agreement on Safeguards, the US also has acted inconsistently with Article
      2.1 of the Agreement on Safeguards.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 31 January 2001, the US notified the DSB of its
      intention to appeal certain issues of law covered in the Panel Report and
      legal interpretations developed by the Panel. The Appellate Body
      circulated its report on 1 May 2001. The Appellate Body:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>upheld the Panel’s finding that the US acted
      inconsistently with Article XIX:1(a) of the GATT 1994 by failing to
      demonstrate, as a matter of fact, the existence of “unforeseen
      developments”;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>upheld the Panel’s finding that the United States acted
      inconsistently with Articles 2.1 and 4.1(c) of the <i> Agreement on Safeguards</i>
      because the USITC defined the relevant “domestic industry” to
      include growers and feeders of live lambs;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>upheld the Panel’s finding that the USITC made a
      determination regarding the “domestic industry” on the basis of
      data that was not sufficiently representative of that industry; but
      modified the Panel’s ultimate finding that the US thereby acted
      inconsistently with Articles 2.1 and 4.1(c) of the <i> Agreement on Safeguards</i>
      by finding, instead, that the United States thereby acted inconsistently
      with Articles 2.1 and 4.2(a) of that Agreement;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>found that the Panel correctly interpreted the standard
      of review, set forth in Article 11 of the DSU, which is appropriate to its
      examination of claims made under Article 4.2 of the <i> Agreement on
          Safeguards</i>; but concluded that the Panel erred in applying that standard
      in examining the claims made concerning the USITC’s determination that
      there existed a threat of serious injury; and found, moreover, that the US
      acted inconsistently with Articles 2.1 and 4.2(a) of the Agreement on
      Safeguards because the USITC Report did not explain adequately the
      determination that there existed a threat of serious injury to the
      domestic industry;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>reversed the Panel’s interpretation of the causation
      requirements in the <i> Agreement on Safeguards</i> but, for
      different reasons, upheld the Panel’s
      ultimate finding that the US acted inconsistently with Articles 2.1 and
      4.2(b) of the Agreement because the USITC’s determination </font>that
      there existed a causal link between increased imports and a threat of
      serious injury did not ensure that injury caused to the domestic industry,
      by factors other than increased imports, was not attributed to those
      imports;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>upheld the Panel’s exercise of
      judicial economy in declining to rule on the claim of New Zealand under
      Article 5.1 of the <i> Agreement on Safeguards</i>; and<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
          <li>declined to rule on the respective conditional appeals
      of Australia and New Zealand relating to Articles I, II and
      XIX:1(a) of the GATT 1994, and to Articles 2.2, 3.1, 5.1, 8.1, 11.1(a) and
      12.3 of the <i> Agreement on Safeguards</i>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="paranormaltext"></font>The DSB adopted the Appellate Body Report and the Panel Report,
      as modified by the Appellate Body Report, on 16 May 2001.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Implementation  of adopted reports</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> At the
      DSB meeting of 20 June 2001, the US recalled that on 14 June 2001 it had
      submitted in writing to the DSB its intentions with respect to the
      implementation in this case and said that it intended to implement the
      DSB’s recommendations in a manner that would respect its WTO obligations.
      The US further stated that it would need a reasonable period of time for
      implementation and, for that reason, it would enter into discussions with
      the complaining parties. On 27 September 2001, the US informed the DSB of
      its decision to implement the recommendations of the DSB by ending the
      safeguard measure effective on 15 November 2001. On 28 September 2001,
      Australia and New Zealand agreed that the reasonable period of time for
    implementation would expire on 15 November 2001.</div>
