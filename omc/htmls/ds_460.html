        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the European Union. (See also <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds454_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS454</a>) </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 13 June 2013, the European Union requested consultations  with China concerning measures imposing anti-dumping duties on certain high-performance  stainless steel seamless tubes (&ldquo;HP-SSST&rdquo;) from the European Union,  as set forth in Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China  (&ldquo;MOFCOM&rdquo;) Notice No. 21 [2012] and Notice No. 72 [2012], including  any and all annexes and any amendments thereof.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The European Union claims that the measures are  inconsistent with:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">Articles 1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.4.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5,  6.4, 6.5, 6.5.1, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.4, 12.2 and 12.2.2 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping  Agreement; and<br />

        <p class="paranormaltext">On 27 June 2013, Japan requested to join the  consultations. Subsequently, China informed the DSB that it had  accepted the request of Japan to join the consultations. On 16 August 2013, the European  Union requested the  establishment of a panel. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
At  its meeting on 30 August 2013, the DSB established a panel. India, Japan,  Korea, Turkey and the United States reserved their third party rights.  Subsequently, the Russian Federation and Saudi Arabia reserved their third  party rights. Following the agreement of the parties, the panel was composed on  11 September 2013.

        <p class="paranormaltext" >These  disputes concern the imposition by China of anti-dumping duties on certain  high-performance stainless steel seamless tubes from Japan and the European  Union. The complainants claimed that the anti-dumping duties imposed by China,  and the underlying investigation conducted by the Chinese investigating  authority (MOFCOM), were inconsistent with various procedural and substantive  provisions of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, and Article VI of the GATT 1994. The  complainants brought virtually identical claims concerning MOFCOM's injury  determination, and MOFCOM's handling of certain procedural issues. The  European&nbsp;Union also brought additional substantive claims in respect of  MOFCOM's determination of dumping.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The  complainants brought a series of Article 3 claims against MOFCOM's  determination that dumped imports had caused injury to the domestic industry. They  claimed that MOFCOM's consideration of the price effects of subject imports was  inconsistent with Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement; that  MOFCOM's assessment of the impact of the dumped imports on the state of the  domestic industry was inconsistent with Articles 3.1 and 3.4 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement; and that MOFCOM's determination that there is a causal  link between dumped imports and material injury to the domestic industry was  inconsistent with Articles 3.1 and 3.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. The  Panels upheld many of the claims under Articles 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5, but did  not side with the complainants on all matters. In particular, the Panels  rejected the complainants' claims under Article 3.2 that MOFCOM was required &mdash;  and failed &mdash; to assess whether price undercutting by the subject imports had  the actual effect of placing downward pressure on domestic prices.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The  complainants claimed that MOFCOM failed to fulfil the requirements of  Article&nbsp;6.8 and Annex&nbsp;II:1 in applying facts available to determine  the all others rates for unknown exporters. The Panels rejected the  complainants' claims. The Panels found that there was no factual basis to  conclude that MOFCOM had failed to inform unknown exporters/producers of the  information required of them, since MOFCOM had posted the exporter  questionnaire on its website.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The  complainants claimed that MOFCOM failed to comply with the Article 6.9  obligation to disclose essential facts regarding its dumping and injury  determinations, and its determination of the all others rates. The Panel  rejected the complainants' claims concerning MOFCOM's use of a narrative  description to disclose essential facts in respect of its dumping  determination. The Panel noted that MOFCOM had provided narrative descriptions  of the essential facts that referred to factual information already in the  exporters' possession. The Panels upheld the claims that MOFCOM failed to  disclose its dumping margin calculation methodology. The Panels also upheld the  bulk of the complainants' claims that MOFCOM had failed to disclose essential  facts pertaining to its injury determination. The Panels rejected the  complainants' claims that MOFCOM had failed to disclose essential facts  regarding the all others rate.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The  complainants claimed that MOFCOM failed to ensure that its public notice of the  Final Determination complied with the requirements of Articles 12.2  and&nbsp;12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. Their claims pertained to  information concerning MOFCOM's injury determination, and MOFCOM's  determination of the all others rates. The Panels rejected certain aspects of  the claims brought in respect of MOFCOM's injury determination, and exercised  judicial economy in respect of others. The Panels upheld one aspect of the  claims brought in respect of MOFCOM's dumping determination, but rejected the  others.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The  complainants claimed that China acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;6.5 of  the Anti-Dumping&nbsp;Agreement because MOFCOM permitted the full text of  certain reports to remain confidential without a proper showing of &ldquo;good  cause&rdquo; for such treatment by the petitioners. The complainants also  claimed that China acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;6.5.1 of the  Anti-Dumping&nbsp;Agreement because MOFCOM failed to require sufficient  non-confidential summaries or explanations as to why such summaries were not  possible. The Panels upheld all of the claims brought by the complainants.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The  complainants claimed that, by applying provisional measures for a period  exceeding four months without meeting the requirements of Article&nbsp;7.4 of  the Anti-Dumping&nbsp;Agreement, China acted inconsistently with that  provision. The Panels upheld these claims.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The European  Union made a number of claims in respect of MOFCOM's dumping determination.  These claims concerned (i) the use of SG&amp;A amounts (Articles 2.2.1, 2.2.1.1  and 2.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement); (ii) the fairness of the comparison  (Article 2.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement); and (iii) the alleged  double-counting of certain administrative expenses (Article 6.7 and Annex I:7  of the Anti-Dumping Agreement). The Panels upheld the European Union's Article  2.2.2 claim concerning SG&amp;A amounts, and exercised judicial economy in  respect of the remaining claims concerning that matter. The Panels upheld the  European Union's fair comparison claim under Article 2.4. The Panels upheld a  procedural aspect of the European&nbsp;Union's claim under Article 6.7 and  Annex I:7 concerning the alleged double-counting of certain administrative  expenses.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">Japan and the  European Union claimed that, by failing to comply with the provisions of  the&nbsp;Anti-Dumping&nbsp;Agreement, China had consequently acted  inconsistently with Article&nbsp;1 of the Anti-Dumping&nbsp;Agreement and  Article VI of the GATT&nbsp;1994. The Panels upheld those consequential claims.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 12 March 2015, China and Japan  requested the DSB to adopt a draft decision  extending the 60&#8209;day time period  stipulated in Article 16.4 of the DSU to 20 May 2015. At  its meeting on 25  March 2015, the DSB agreed that, it shall no later than 20 May  2015, adopt the panel report unless (i) the DSB  decides by consensus not to do so or (ii) China or Japan notifies  the DSB of its decision to appeal the panel report.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 20 May 2015, China notified the DSB of its decision  to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law and legal interpretation  in the panel report. On 26 May 2015, the  European Union also notified the DSB of its decision to  appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law and legal interpretation in  the panel report.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On  28 July 2015, upon expiry of the 60-day period provided for in Article 17.5 of  the DSU, the Appellate Body informed the DSB that the Appellate Body Reports in  these appeal proceedings as well as in those of DS454, would be circulated to  WTO Members no later than Wednesday, 14 October 2015.</p>

      <div aria-labelledby="headingTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseB" role="tabpanel">
          <div class="panel-body">
    	<p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Data for SG&amp;A amounts</strong>: The  Appellate Body upheld the Panel's finding that the European&nbsp;Union's claims  under Articles&nbsp;2.2.1 and 2.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement were properly  within the Panel's terms of reference. The Appellate Body also upheld the  Panel's finding that China acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;2.2.2 of the  Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement by failing to determine selling, general and  administrative (SG&amp;A) costs for Salzgitter Mannesmann Stainless Tubes GmbH  (SMST), one of the EU&nbsp;companies investigated by MOFCOM, on the basis of  actual data pertaining to production and sales in the ordinary course of trade  of the like product.</p>
    	<p class="paranormaltext"> <strong>Verification</strong>: The  Appellate Body upheld the Panel's finding that China acted inconsistently with  Article&nbsp;6.7 and paragraph&nbsp;7 of Annex&nbsp;I to the Anti&#8209;Dumping  Agreement because MOFCOM rejected SMST's request for correction of certain  information on the sole basis that it was not provided prior to the  verification visit carried out by MOFCOM.</p>
    	<p class="paranormaltext"> <strong>Good cause</strong>: The  Appellate Body saw no error in the Panel's conclusion that, in the absence of <em>any evidence</em> that MOFCOM objectively  assessed the &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; alleged, it had no basis to conclude that  MOFCOM undertook an objective assessment and properly determined that the  petitioners had shown &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; for their requests for confidential  treatment. The Appellate Body therefore upheld the Panel's finding that China  acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;6.5 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement  because MOFCOM permitted the full text of the four reports at issue to remain  confidential without objectively assessing &ldquo;the petitioners' showing of  &lsquo;good cause&rsquo;&rdquo;. In doing so, the Appellate Body noted that an investigating  authority &ldquo;must objectively assess the &lsquo;good cause&rsquo; alleged for  confidential treatment, and scrutinize the party's showing in order to determine  whether the submitting party has sufficiently substantiated its request&rdquo;.  It added that a panel tasked with reviewing whether an investigating authority  has objectively assessed the &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; alleged by a party must  examine this issue on the basis of the investigating authority's published  report and its related supporting documents, and in the light of the nature of  the information at issue and the reasons given by the submitting party for its  request for confidential treatment. </p>
    	<p class="paranormaltext"> <strong>Disclosure of essential facts</strong>: The  Appellate Body reversed the Panel's finding rejecting the European&nbsp;Union's  claim that China acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;6.9 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping  Agreement, and found instead that China acted inconsistently with that  provision because MOFCOM failed to disclose adequately the essential facts in  connection with the data underlying MOFCOM's determination of dumping with  respect to the EU&nbsp;companies investigated by MOFCOM. It noted that whether  a particular fact is essential or &ldquo;significant in the process of reaching  a decision&rdquo; depends on the nature and scope of the particular substantive  obligations, the content of the particular findings needed to satisfy the  substantive obligations at issue, and the factual circumstances of each case,  including the arguments and evidence submitted by the interested parties. The  Appellate Body explained that it did not see how the mere fact that the  investigating authority may be referring to data that are in the possession of  an interested party would mean that it has disclosed the essential facts in a  coherent way, so as to permit an interested party to understand the basis for  each of the intermediate findings and conclusions reached by the authority and  the decision whether or not to apply definitive measures such that it is able  properly to defend its interests.</p>
    	<p class="paranormaltext"> <strong>MOFCOM's price effects  analysis:</strong> Contrary to the Panel, the Appellate Body found that Article&nbsp;3.2  requires a dynamic assessment of price developments and trends in the  relationship between the prices of the dumped imports and those of domestic  like products, and that the investigating authority may not disregard evidence  suggesting that the prices of dumped imports have no, or only a limited effect  on domestic prices. The Appellate Body added that while an examination of  whether there is a price differential between imported and domestic products  may be a useful starting point for an analysis of price undercutting, it does  not provide a sufficient basis for an investigating authority to satisfy its  obligation under Article&nbsp;3.2. The Appellate&nbsp;Body therefore reversed  the Panel's finding rejecting the European Union's claims that China acted  inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.2 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement,  and found instead that MOFCOM's assessment of whether there had been a  significant price undercutting by Grade&nbsp;C imports, as compared with the  price of the domestic Grade&nbsp;C, was inconsistent with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and  3.2 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement. The Appellate Body also reversed the Panel's  finding rejecting the European&nbsp;Union's claim that MOFCOM acted  inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.2 by improperly extending its  finding of price undercutting in respect of Grades&nbsp;B and C to the domestic  like product as a whole, including Grade&nbsp;A HP-SSST.</p>
    	<p class="paranormaltext"> <strong>MOFCOM's impact analysis:</strong> The  Appellate&nbsp;Body found that the Panel erred in its interpretation of  Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.4 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement to the extent it found  that the results of the inquiries under Article&nbsp;3.2 are not relevant to  the impact analysis under Article&nbsp;3.4. The Appellate&nbsp;Body recalled  that Article&nbsp;3.4 does not merely require an examination of the state of  the domestic industry, but contemplates that an investigating authority must  derive an understanding of the impact of subject imports on the basis of such  an examination. The Appellate&nbsp;Body observed that, in order to examine the  impact of the dumped imports on the state of the domestic industry, an  investigating authority may be required to take into account the relative  market shares of product types with respect to which it has made a finding of  price undercutting, as well as the duration and extent of price undercutting,  price depression, or price suppression, that it has found to exist. The  Appellate Body therefore reversed the Panel's findings rejecting the European  Union's claims that China acted inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.4  because MOFCOM did not undertake a segmented analysis of the impact of the  dumped imports on the state of the domestic industry.</p>
    	<p class="paranormaltext"> <strong>MOFCOM's causation analysis</strong>: The  Appellate Body upheld the Panel's findings that China acted inconsistently with  Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because MOFCOM  improperly relied on the market share of dumped imports, and its flawed price  effects and impact analyses, in determining a causal link between dumped  imports and material injury to the domestic industry, and made no finding of  cross-grade price effects whereby price undercutting by Grade&nbsp;B and C  imports might be shown to affect the price of domestic Grade&nbsp;A HP&#8209;SSST.  The Appellate Body also upheld the Panel's findings that China acted  inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.5 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement  because MOFCOM failed to ensure that the injury caused by other known factors  was not attributed to the dumped imports. In addition, the Appellate&nbsp;Body  upheld the Panel's finding that the European Union had not advanced any  independent Article&nbsp;3.5 claims &mdash; other than those concerning MOFCOM's  reliance on market shares and MOFCOM's non&#8209;attribution analysis &mdash; concerning  MOFCOM's price effects and impact analyses.</p>
    	<p class="paranormaltext"> <strong>BCI Procedures</strong>: The  Appellate Body found that the Panel conflated: (i)&nbsp;the confidentiality  obligations under Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement setting the framework for  confidential treatment of information that is applicable in the context of  domestic anti-dumping proceedings; and (ii)&nbsp;the confidentiality  obligations applicable in WTO dispute settlement proceedings. The Appellate  Body also found that the Panel conflated: (i)&nbsp;confidentiality requirements  generally applicable in WTO proceedings or in anti&#8209;dumping proceedings as  foreseen in the above&#8209;mentioned provisions of the DSU and the Anti&#8209;Dumping  Agreement; and (ii)&nbsp;the additional layer of protection of sensitive  business information provided under special procedures adopted by a panel for  the purposes of a particular dispute. The Appellate Body stated that whether  information treated as confidential pursuant to Article&nbsp;6.5 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping  Agreement, and submitted by a party to a WTO panel under the confidentiality  requirements generally applicable in WTO dispute settlement, should receive  additional confidential treatment as BCI, is to be determined in each case by a  panel. The Appellate&nbsp;Body therefore declared moot and of no legal effect  the relevant findings by the Panel. The Appellate Body did not consider it  necessary to make further findings on this matter in order to resolve the  present dispute.</p>
