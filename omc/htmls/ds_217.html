		<h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Joint complaint by Australia, Brazil, Chile, European
      Communities, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and Thailand.</strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 21 December 2000 and 21 May 2001
      respectively, the complainants requested consultations with the US
      concerning the amendment to the Tariff Act of 1930 signed on 28 October
      2000 with the title of “Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of
      2000” (the “Act”) usually referred to as “the Byrd Amendment”.
      According to the complainants the Act is inconsistent with the obligations
      of the United States under several provisions of the GATT, the AD
      Agreement, the SCM Agreement, and the WTO Agreement. In particular, the
      Act is alleged to be inconsistent with the obligations of the United
      States under: (i) Article 18.1 of the ADA in conjunction with Article VI:2
      of the GATT and Article 1 of the ADA; (ii) Article 32.1 of the SCM
      Agreement, in conjunction with Article VI:3 of the GATT and Articles 4.10,
      7.9 and 10 of the SCM Agreement; (iii) Article X(3)(a) of the GATT; (iv)
      Article 5.4 of the ADA and Article 11.4 of the SCM Agreement; (v) Article
      8 of the ADA and Article 18 of the SCM Agreement; (vi) Article 5 of the
      SCM Agreement; and (vii) Article XVI:4 of the Marrakesh Agreement
      establishing the WTO, Article 18.4 of the ADA and Article 32.5 of the SCM
      Agreement.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 12 July 2001, the complainants in dispute WT/DS217
      requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 24 July 2001,
      the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Further to a second request
        to establish a panel by the complainants, the DSB established a panel at
        its meeting on 23 August 2001. Argentina; Canada; Costa Rica; Hong Kong,
        China; Israel; Norway and Mexico reserved their third-party rights.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 10 August 2001, Canada and Mexico requested the
      establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 23 August 2001, the DSB
      deferred the establishment of a panel. Further to a second request to
      establish a panel by Canada and Mexico, the DSB established a panel at its
      meeting on 10 September 2001. The DSB also agreed, in accordance with
      Article 9 of the DSU, that the panel established to examine the complaint
      by Australia, Brazil, Chile, EC, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and
      Thailand (WT/DS217) on 23 August 2001 would also examine the complaint by
      Canada and Mexico (WT/DS234).</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 15 October 2001, all 11 complainants requested the
      Director-General to determine the composition of the Panel. On 25 October
      2001, the Panel was composed. On 17 April 2002, the Chairman of the Panel
      informed the DSB that the Panel would not be able to complete its work in
      six months since the parties were given the maximum amount of time for
      preparing submissions and oral statements. The Panel expected to complete
      its work by July 2002.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 16 September 2002, the Panel Report was circulated
      to Members. The Panel concluded that the CDSOA was inconsistent with
      Articles 5.4, 18.1 and 18.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, Articles 11.4,
      32.1 and 32.5 of the Subsidies Agreement, Articles VI:2 and VI:3 of the
      GATT 1994, and Article XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement. The Panel rejected the
      complaining parties’ claims that the CDSOA was inconsistent with
      Articles 8.3 and 15 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, Articles 4.10, 7.9 and
      18.3 of the Subsidies Agreement, and Article X:3(a) of the GATT 1994. They
      also rejected Mexico’s claim that the CDSOA violated SCM Article 5(b).
      The CDSOA is a new and complex measure, applied in a complex legal
      environment. In concluding that the CDSOA was in violation of the
      abovementioned provisions, the Panel had been confronted by sensitive
      issues regarding the use of subsidies as trade remedies. If Members were
      of the view that subsidisation is a permitted response to unfair trade
      practices, the Panel suggested that they clarify this matter through
      negotiation. Pursuant to Article 3.8 of the DSU, the Panel concluded that
      to the extent that the CDSOA was inconsistent with the provisions of the
      Anti-Dumping Agreement, the SCM Agreement, and the GATT 1994, the CDSOA
      nullified or impaired benefits accruing to the complaining parties under
      those agreements. The Panel recommended that the DSB request the United
      States to bring the CDSOA into conformity with its obligations under the
      Anti-Dumping Agreement, the SCM Agreement, and the GATT of 1994 by
      repealing the CDSOA.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 18 October 2002, the United States notified its
      decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in
      the Panel Report and certain legal interpretations developed by the Panel.
      On 13 December 2002, the Appellate Body informed the DSB that it was not
      able to circulate the Report within 60 days from the appeal and that the
      Report was to be circulated no later than 16 January 2003. On 16 January
      2003, the Appellate Body circulated its Report. The Appellate Body:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li> upheld the finding of the Panel, in paragraphs 7.51
      and 8.1 of the Panel Report, that the CDSOA is a non-permissible specific
      action against dumping or a subsidy, contrary to Article 18.1 of the <i>
      Anti-Dumping Agreement</i> and Article 32.1 of the <i> SCM Agreement</i>;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>consequently upheld the Panel’s finding, in
      paragraphs 7.93 and 8.1 of the Panel Report, that the CDSOA is
      inconsistent with certain provisions of the <i> Anti-Dumping Agreement</i> and the
          <i>
      SCM Agreement</i> and that, therefore, the United States has failed to comply
      with Article 18.4 of the <i> Anti-Dumping Agreement</i>, Article 32.5 of the
          <i> SCM
      Agreement</i> and Article XVI:4 of the <i> WTO Agreement</i>;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>upheld the Panel’s finding, in paragraph 8.4 of
      the Panel Report, that, pursuant to Article 3.8 of the DSU, to the extent
      that the CDSOA is inconsistent with provisions of the <i> Anti-Dumping
      Agreement</i> and the <i> SCM Agreement</i>, the CDSOA nullifies or impairs benefits
      accruing to the Complaining Parties under those Agreements;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>reversed the Panel’s findings, in paragraphs 7.66
      and 8.1 of the Panel Report, that the CDSOA is inconsistent with Article
      5.4 of the <i> Anti-Dumping Agreement</i> and Article 11.4 of the <i> SCM
          Agreement</i>;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>rejected the Panel’s conclusion, in paragraph
      7.63 of the Panel Report, that the United States may be regarded as not
      having acted in good faith with respect to its obligations under Article
      5.4 of the <i> Anti-Dumping Agreement</i> and Article 11.4 of the <i> SCM
          Agreement</i>;
      and<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>rejected the claim of the United States that the
      Panel acted inconsistently with Article 9.2 of the DSU by not issuing a
      separate panel report in the dispute brought by Mexico.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body recommended that the DSB request the
      United States bring the CDSOA into conformity with its obligations under
      the <i> Anti-Dumping Agreement</i>, the <i> SCM Agreement</i>, and the GATT 1994. Further
      to Canada’s request, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body Report and the
      Panel Report, as modified by the Appellate Body, at its meeting on 27
      January 2003.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Implementation  of adopted reports</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 14 March 2003, the complainants requested
        arbitration under Article 21.3(c) of the DSU to determine the reasonable
        period of time for implementation by the US of the DSB recommendations. On
        24 March 2003, the complainants requested the Director-General to appoint
        the arbitrator in consultation with the parties pursuant to footnote 12 of
        the DSU. On 4 April 2003, the Director-General appointed an Arbitrator. On
        13 June 2003, the Arbitrator issued its award to the parties. The
        Arbitrator concluded that the “reasonable period of time” for
        the United States to implement the DSB’s recommendations and rulings
        should be 11 months from the date of the DSB’s adoption of the Panel and
        Appellate Body Reports in this dispute. The reasonable period of time will
      therefore expire on 27 December 2003.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">On 14 January 2004, the DSB was informed that the
        United States had mutually agreed to modify the reasonable period of time
        with Thailand, Australia and Indonesia, respectively, so as to expire on
        27 December 2004.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Compliance  proceedings</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 15 January 2004, on the grounds that the US had
		  failed to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings within the
		  reasonable period of time, Brazil, Chile, the EC, India, Japan, Korea,
		  Canada and Mexico requested the DSB authorization to suspend concessions
		  pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU. On 23 January 2004, the US requested,
		  in accordance with Article 22.6 of the DSU, that the matter be referred to
		  arbitration, since the US objected to the level of suspension of
		  concessions proposed by the foregoing parties. At its meeting on 26
		  January 2004, the DSB decided to refer the matter to arbitration.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">On 31 August 2004, the arbitrator circulated its
        decisions. The arbitrator determined:</p>      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>It rejects the position of Brazil, Canada, Chile, the
      European Communities, India, Japan, Korea and Mexico that the level of
      suspension of concessions or other obligations should be equivalent to the
      disbursements made by the United States under the measure at issue, <i>i.e.</i>, CDSOA. The Arbitrator considered that this interpretation was not
      supported by the terms of Article XXIII of GATT 1994 or the DSU. The
      Arbitrator found it appropriate to rely on the economic effect of the
      measure, as was done in previous Article 22.6 arbitrations.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>The Arbitrator applied an economic model aimed at
      assessing the effect of disbursements under the CDSOA on exports of the
      above-mentioned Members to the United States, and thus came up with a
      coefficient which, multiplied by the amounts disbursed by the United
      States under the CDSOA in relation to anti-dumping or countervailing
      duties collected on imports from each of the those Members, gives an
      assessment of the economic effect of the CDSOA on exports from each of
      those Members for a given period.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>The Arbitrators’ decisions do not provide for an
      actual, single value of trade not to be exceeded by the above-mentioned
      Members when suspending concessions or other obligations <i> vis-à-vis</i> the
      United States. The awards allow those Members to suspend concessions or
      other obligations up to a maximum value of trade to be calculated by
      multiplying the published amount of disbursements under the CDSOA for a
      given year by the coefficient calculated by the Arbitrator.</li>
        </ul>      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Proceedings  under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 10 November 2004, Brazil, the European Communities,
        India, Japan, Korea, Canada and Mexico requested authorization to suspend
        concessions or other obligations under Article 22.7 of the DSU. At its
        meeting of 26 November 2004, the DSB authorized the suspension of
        concessions. On 6 December 2004, Chile requested authorization to suspend
        concessions or other obligations under Article 22.7 of the DSU. At is
        meeting of 17 December 2004, the DSB authorized the suspension of
        concessions.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 23 December 2004, 7 and 11 January 2005, Australia,
        Thailand and Indonesia, respectively, reached Understanding with the
        United States with respect to this dispute. At its meeting of 25 January
        2005, the DSB agreed to take note of these Understandings.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 29 April 2005, the European Communities and Canada notified the DSB that they were suspending, as of 1 May 2005, the application of concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America. The notifications from the European Communities and Canada say that, for the first year, an ad valorem additional duty of 15 per cent will be imposed on certain products originating in the United States of America, which would cover, over one year, a total value of trade that does not exceed US$ 27.81 million (in respect of the European Communities) and US$ 11.16 million (in respect of Canada) respectively. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 18 August&nbsp;2005, Japan notified the DSB that they were suspending, as of 1 September 2005, the application of concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 on imports of certain products originating in the United States. The notification from Japan states that, for the first year, an ad&nbsp;valorem additional duty of 15 per cent will be imposed on certain products originating in the United States, which would cover, over one year, a total value of trade that does not exceed US$&nbsp;52.10 million. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 17 February 2006, the United States stated that the US Congress had approved the Deficit Reduction Act on 1 February 2006 and the President had signed the Act into law on 8 February 2006 bringing the US into conformity with its WTO obligations. Australia; Brazil; Canada; Chile; Indonesia; Hong Kong, China; India; Japan; Korea; Mexico; Thailand and the European Communities welcomed the recent steps taken by Congress towards the repeal of the CDSOA but disagreed with the United States that it had brought its measures fully into conformity with the DSB&rsquo;s recommendations and rulings. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On  28 April 2006, 19 April 2007, 3 April 2008, 23 April 2009, 22 April 2010, 8  April 2011, 7 May 2012, 22 May 2013, 2 April 2014, 11 May 2015, 13 May 2016,   11 May 2017, 7 May  2018,  10 May 2019, 26  June 2020,  20 June 2022, 24  June 2022 and  8 February 2024, the European Union notified to the DSB the list of products on which an additional  import duty would be imposed further to the authorized suspension of  concessions and  the duty rate thereof. On  30 April 2024  and 27 May 2025,  the European Union notified the DSB that,  for the years starting on 1 May 2024 and  on 1 May 2025, the  level of authorized suspension was  negligible, and therefore  the rate of additional import  duty for the list of products previously notified was  set at 0%. The European  Union noted that it retained its rights  under Article 22 of the DSU. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On  22 August 2006, 23 August 2007, 29 August 2008, 14 August 2009, 25 August 2010,  26 August 2011, 23 August 2012, and 23 August 2013, Japan notified to the DSB  the list of products on which an additional import duty would be imposed  further to the authorized suspension of concessions. On 18&nbsp;August 2014,  Japan notified the DSB that it was going to discontinue the suspension of concessions  starting on 1 September 2014 because the authorized level of suspension of  concessions was marginal. On 18 September 2015 and 22 August 2016, Japan  notified the DSB that the authorized level of suspension of concessions continued  to be marginal and therefore no concessions would be suspended. On  30 November 2017, 9  November 2018, 15 August 2019, 25  September 2020,   30 September 2021,  30 September 2022, 22 September 2023, and 18 September 2024,  Japan notified the DSB that, although it acknowledged the  amount of relevant disbursements to US companies, it continued its  non-application of the suspension of concessions.</p>
