        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint  by Argentina. </strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> On  19 December 2013, Argentina requested consultations with the European Union  regarding (a)&nbsp;provisional  and definitive anti-dumping measures imposed on biodiesel originating in, <em>inter alia</em>, Argentina, as well as the  investigation underlying the measures; and, (b) a provision in Council Regulation  (EC) 1225/2009 of November 2009, which refers to the adjustment or  establishment of costs associated with the production and sale of products  under investigation in the determination of dumping margins. </p>
        <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> Argentina  claimed that the measures were inconsistent with:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">Articles 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1.1,  2.2.2, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.5.1, 9.3, 18 and 18.4 of the  Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement; <br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">Article VI of the GATT 1994;  and <br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">Article XVI:4 of the WTO  Agreement. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 9 January 2014, the  Russian  Federation  requested to join the consultations.  On 15 January 2014, Indonesia requested to join the  consultations. Subsequently, the  European Union informed the DSB that it had accepted the request of Indonesia  to join the consultations.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 13 March 2014, Argentina requested  the establishment of a panel. At  its meeting on 26 March 2014, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 25 April 2014, the DSB  established a panel. Australia, China,  Malaysia, Norway, the  Russian  Federation, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and  the United States reserved their third-party rights.  Subsequently, Colombia, Indonesia and  Mexico reserved their third-party rights.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 13 June 2014, Argentina requested the  Director-General to compose the panel. On 23 June 2014,  the Director-General composed the panel. On 10 December 2014, the Chair of the panel  informed the DSB that the start of the  proceedings was delayed owing to the  unavailability of panelists and a lack of available  experienced Secretariat lawyers, and that the panel expected to issue its  final report to the parties by the end of 2015.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">Following the resigniaton of one of the members of  the panel on 15 February 2015, the Director&#8209;General appointed a new member of the  panel on 18 February 2015.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 18 December 2015, the Chair of the Panel  informed the DSB that, due to the complexity of the legal and factual issues  arising in the dispute, the Panel now expected to issue its final report to the  parties by the end of February 2016.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
    	<p  class="paranormaltext">This dispute concerns two sets of measures of the  European Union. First, Argentina makes &ldquo;as such&rdquo; claims against  Article 2(5), second subparagraph, of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1225/2009 of  30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members  of the European Community (the Basic Regulation). Second, Argentina challenges  certain aspects of the anti-dumping measures imposed by the European Union on  imports of biodiesel from Argentina.</p>
    	<p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Terms of  reference</strong></p>
    	<p class="paranormaltext">
    	  The European Union requested that the Panel find that  a number of claims set forth in Argentina's panel request fell outside the  scope of the Panel's terms of reference. Argentina did not pursue certain of  the claims identified in the European Union's objections. The Panel found that  each of the three claims subject to the remaining objections fell within its  terms of reference.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Argentina's &ldquo;as such&rdquo;  claims</strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">Argentina  claimed that Article 2(5), second subparagraph, of the Basic Regulation is  inconsistent with Article&nbsp;2.2.1.1 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement by  providing that the authorities shall reject or adjust the cost data of the  producers/exporters as included in their records when those costs reflect  prices which are &ldquo;abnormally or artificially low&rdquo; because they are  affected by an alleged distortion. The Panel rejected Argentina's claims,  considering that the challenged provision prescribes what has to be done after  the EU authorities have determined that a producer's records do not reasonably  reflect the costs of production, and does not govern the determination of  whether those records reasonably reflect the costs of production, as Argentina  had alleged. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">In  addition, Argentina claimed that the provision at issue is inconsistent with  Article&nbsp;2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI:1(b)(ii) of the  GATT 1994 by providing that the costs shall be adjusted or established in  certain cases &ldquo;on any other reasonable basis, including information from  other representative markets&rdquo;. The Panel also rejected these claims.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Argentina's claims with respect  to anti-dumping measures on biodiesel from Argentina</strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">Argentina made claims with regard to both the dumping  and injury determinations of the EU authorities. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Regarding the EU authorities' dumping determination,  Argentina claimed, first, that the EU authorities acted inconsistently with  Article 2.2.1.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, and as a consequence, Article  2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI:1(b)(ii) of the GATT 1994, by  failing to calculate the cost of production of biodiesel on the basis of the  records kept by the producers/exporter under investigation. The EU authorities  had made this determination based on their conclusion that the Argentine  domestic prices of soybeans were distorted due to the difference in the export  taxes imposed by Argentina on the input (soybeans) and those imposed on the  finished product (biodiesel). As a result, when constructing the Argentine  producers' normal value, the EU authorities replaced the costs reported in the  Argentine producers/exporters' records for soybeans with reference prices  published by the Argentine Ministry of Agriculture. In the EU authorities'  view, these prices reflected the level of international prices and the price  that would have prevailed in Argentina but for the distortion. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The Panel  upheld Argentina's claim that the European Union acted inconsistently with  Article 2.2.1.1 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement by failing to calculate the cost  of production of biodiesel on the basis of the records kept by the producers/exporter  under investigation. The Panel considered that the reason stated by the EU  authorities for disregarding producers' costs &mdash; i.e. because the prices for the  input were artificially lower than international prices due to an alleged  distortion &mdash; does not constitute a legally sufficient basis under Article  2.2.1.1 for concluding that the producers' records do not reasonably reflect  the costs associated with the production and sale of biodiesel. Since the Panel  found a violation of Article 2.2.1.1, it found it unnecessary to consider  Argentina's claims under Article 2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article  VI:1(b)(ii) of the GATT 1994.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">In addition, the Panel upheld Argentina's claim  that the European Union acted inconsistently with Article 2.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI:1(b)(ii) of the GATT 1994 by using a  &ldquo;cost&rdquo; that was not the cost prevailing &ldquo;in the country of  origin&rdquo;, Argentina, in the construction of the normal value. The Panel  considered it plain from the EU authorities' reasoning that the cost used was  not a cost &ldquo;in the country of origin&rdquo;, since it was specifically  selected to remove the perceived distortion in the domestic price of soybeans  caused by the Argentine export tax system. The Panel exercised judicial economy  on Argentina's claim that the EU authorities acted inconsistently with Article  2.2.1.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because they included costs not  associated with the production and sale of biodiesel in the calculation of the  cost of production. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Finally, the Panel considered it unnecessary for  the effective resolution of the dispute to reach a finding on Argentina's claims  under Article 2.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI:1 of the GATT  1994.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Argentina claimed that the EU authorities acted  inconsistently with Article&nbsp;2.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement by failing  to make due allowance for differences affecting price comparability. The Panel rejected  this claim.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The Panel upheld Argentina's claim that the  European Union acted inconsistently with Article 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT 1994 by imposing anti&#8209;dumping duties in  excess of the margin of dumping that should have been established under Article  2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. The Panel upheld these claims, reasoning that  both Article 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT  1994 refer to the margin of dumping established in a manner consistent with  Article 2, as opposed to whatever margin (WTO-consistent or not) was actually  established by the investigating authority.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The Panel rejected Argentina's claims that the EU  authorities acted inconsistently with Articles 2.2 and 2.2.2(iii) of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement by failing to base the amount for profits component of  the constructed normal value on a reasonable method within the meaning of  Article 2.2.2(iii). The Panel considered that the profit margin selected by the  EU authorities was the result of a reasoned analysis that was rationally  directed at approximating what the Argentine producers' profit margin for the  like product would have been if the like product had been sold in the ordinary  course of trade in the domestic market of the exporting country. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Regarding the injury determination, Argentina  claimed that the EU authorities acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.4  of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, by excluding certain production capacity not  available for use (so-called &ldquo;idle capacity&rdquo;) in their consideration  of the domestic industry's production capacity and capacity utilization. The  Panel found that the EU authorities failed to base their determination of these  two injury factors on an &ldquo;objective examination&rdquo; of &ldquo;positive  evidence&rdquo; in accepting revised data submitted by the EU domestic industry  at a late stage of the investigation without assuring themselves of its  accuracy and reliability, thereby acting inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and  3.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Argentina also challenged the EU authorities'  consideration of four factors other than dumped imported allegedly causing injury  to the domestic industry, namely the domestic industry's overcapacity, the imports  of the investigated product made by the domestic industry, the double-counting  regimes of certain EU member States, and the lack of vertical integration of  and access to raw material of the EU domestic industry. Argentina claimed that  the European Union acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.5 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement by failing to appropriately assess the injury caused by these  factors other than dumped imports and to separate and distinguish that injury from  the injury caused by the allegedly dumped imports. The Panel rejected  Argentina's claim as it concerned each of the four &ldquo;other factors&rdquo;. </p>

<p class="paranormaltext">On 20 May 2016, the  European Union notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body  certain issues of law and legal interpretation in the panel report. On 25  May 2016, Argentina notified the DSB of its decision to cross-appeal.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 19 July 2016, upon expiry of the 60-day period  provided for in Article 17.5 of the DSU, the Appellate Body informed the DSB  that the circulation date of the Appellate Body report in this appeal will be  communicated to the participants and third participants shortly after the oral  hearing, in the light of scheduling of parallel appeals, the number and  complexity of the issues raised in this and concurrent appellate proceedings, the  availability of translation services, and shortage of staff in the Appellate  Body Secretariat. On 9 August 2016, the Appellate Body informed the DSB that it  expected to circulate its report in this appeal no later than 6 October 2016.</p>

    	<p class="paranormaltext">Argentina appealed all of the Panel's findings concerning  the Basic&nbsp;Regulation. In addition, the European&nbsp;Union and Argentina each  appealed several aspects of the Panel's findings concerning the anti&#8209;dumping  measure imposed by the European&nbsp;Union on imports of biodiesel from  Argentina. However, the Panel's findings under Articles&nbsp;2.2.2, 3.1, and  3.4 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement were not subject to appeal.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Challenges to the Panel's findings on Argentina's claims with respect  to the anti&#8209;dumping measures on biodiesel from Argentina </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">
          With respect to the anti&#8209;dumping measures on imports of  biodiesel from Argentina, the European&nbsp;Union challenged the Panel's  findings that the European Union acted inconsistently with  Articles&nbsp;2.2.1.1, 2.2 and 9.3 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement, and  Article&nbsp;VI:1(b)(ii) and VI:2 of the GATT&nbsp;1994. In addition, Argentina  challenged the Panel's rejection of its claims under Articles&nbsp;2.4, 3.1 and  3.5 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> As regards Article&nbsp;2.2.1.1 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement, the Appellate Body observed that this provision governs  investigating authorities' determination of the costs of producing the relevant  product. Its first sentence provides that &ldquo;costs  shall normally be calculated on the basis of records kept by the exporter or  producer under investigation&rdquo; if two conditions are met. The  Appellate Body considered that the second condition, &ldquo;provided that such  records &hellip; reasonably reflect the costs associated  with the production and sale of the product under consideration&rdquo;,  concerns whether the records kept by the exporter or producer under  investigation suitably and sufficiently correspond to or reproduce those costs  incurred by the investigated exporter or producer that have a genuine  relationship with the production and sale of the specific product under  consideration. To the Appellate Body, the Panel's interpretation did not  conflict with its understanding of this provision. The Appellate Body also  agreed with the Panel that the EU&nbsp;authorities' determination that domestic  prices of soybeans in Argentina were &ldquo;artificially low&rdquo; due to the  Argentine&nbsp;differential export tax system was not, in itself, a sufficient  basis for concluding that the producers' records did not reasonably reflect the  costs of soybeans associated with the production and sale of biodiesel. The  Appellate Body therefore upheld the Panel's finding that the  European&nbsp;Union acted inconsistently with the first sentence of Article&nbsp;2.2.1.1  of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement by failing to calculate the cost of  production of biodiesel on the basis of the records kept by the Argentine  producers.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate&nbsp;Body noted that Article&nbsp;2.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article&nbsp;VI:1(b)(ii) of the GATT&nbsp;1994  require that the normal value be constructed on the basis of, <em>inter alia</em>, the &ldquo;cost of production  [&hellip;] in the country of origin&rdquo;. Like the Panel, the Appellate Body considered that the phrase &ldquo;cost  of production [&hellip;] in the country of origin&rdquo; does not limit the sources of  information or evidence that may be used in establishing such cost to sources  inside the country of origin. The  Appellate&nbsp;Body further considered that, when relying on any  out-of-country information, an investigating authority has to ensure that such  information is used to arrive at the cost of production in the country of  origin, and this may require the investigating authority to adapt that  information. The Appellate&nbsp;Body also agreed with the Panel that the surrogate price for soybeans used by  the EU&nbsp;authorities to calculate the cost of production of biodiesel in  Argentina was not a cost &ldquo;in the country of origin&rdquo;. The  Appellate&nbsp;Body therefore upheld the Panel's finding that the European&nbsp;Union  acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;2.2 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement  and Article&nbsp;VI:1(b)(ii) of the GATT&nbsp;1994 because the EU&nbsp;authorities  did not use the cost of production in Argentina when constructing the normal  value of biodiesel.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Having upheld the Panel findings above, and notwithstanding  its reservations about certain aspects of the Panel's analysis under  Article&nbsp;2.4 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement, the Appellate&nbsp;Body  did not consider it fruitful to further examine whether the EU authorities also  failed to conduct a &ldquo;fair comparison&rdquo; in comparing the constructed  normal value to the export price. The Appellate&nbsp;Body therefore found it  unnecessary to rule on Argentina's claim regarding the Panel's finding under  Article&nbsp;2.4 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> As regards the imposition of anti&#8209;dumping duties, the  Appellate&nbsp;Body upheld the Panel's finding that the European&nbsp;Union  acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;9.3 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement  and Article&nbsp;VI:2 of the GATT&nbsp;1994 by imposing anti&#8209;dumping duties in  excess of the margin of dumping that should have been established under  Article&nbsp;2 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement and Article&nbsp;VI:1 of the  GATT&nbsp;1994, respectively. The Appellate Body agreed with the Panel that the  reference to &ldquo;margin of dumping&rdquo; in Article&nbsp;9.3 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement  relates to a margin that is established consistently with Article&nbsp;2. The  Appellate Body concurred with the Panel that, in light of the specific  circumstances of this dispute, Argentina had made a <em>prima&nbsp;facie</em> case that the European&nbsp;Union acted  inconsistently with Article&nbsp;9.3 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement, which  the European&nbsp;Union had failed to rebut.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> With respect to the European&nbsp;Union's non-attribution  analysis on one of the four factors other than dumped imports allegedly causing  injury, the Appellate&nbsp;Body upheld the Panel's finding that Argentina had  not established that the European&nbsp;Union's non-attribution analysis was  inconsistent with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.5 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement.  The Appellate Body found that the Panel did not err in interpreting  Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.5 because, contrary to Argentina's argument, the Panel  did not articulate a legal standard pursuant to which it is relevant to examine  whether the revised data played a significant role in the EU authorities'  non-attribution analysis. The Appellate Body also rejected Argentina's claim  that the Panel erred in its application of Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.5 because  Argentina did not establish that the Panel erred: (i) in concluding that the EU  authorities' non-attribution analysis concerning overcapacity in the Definitive  Regulation was not &ldquo;based on&rdquo; or &ldquo;affected by&rdquo; the revised  data; or (ii) in finding that the EU authorities were not required to give  priority to the evolution of the domestic industry's overcapacity in absolute  terms as opposed to its evolution in relative terms.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> <strong>Challenges to the Panel's findings regarding Argentina's &ldquo;as  such&rdquo; claims:</strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">
          Concerning the second subparagraph of Article&nbsp;2(5) of  the Basic&nbsp;Regulation, Argentina challenged the Panel's findings that  Argentina had not established that this measure is inconsistent &ldquo;as  such&rdquo; with Articles&nbsp;2.2.1.1, 2.2, and 18.4 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement,  Article&nbsp;VI:1(b(ii) of the GATT&nbsp;1994, and XVI:4 of the  WTO&nbsp;Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate&nbsp;Body upheld the Panel's finding that  Argentina had not established that the second subparagraph of Article&nbsp;2(5)  of the Basic Regulation is inconsistent &ldquo;as such&rdquo; with  Article&nbsp;2.2.1.1 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement. The Appellate Body  considered that the Panel did not err in finding that the second subparagraph  of Article&nbsp;2(5) of the Basic&nbsp;Regulation does not require the  European&nbsp;Union to determine that a producer's records do not reasonably  reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the product under  consideration when these records reflect prices considered to be  &ldquo;artificially or abnormally low&rdquo; as a result of a distortion. Like  the Panel, the Appellate&nbsp;Body found no support in the text of the  Basic&nbsp;Regulation, or in the other elements relied on by Argentina, for the  view that the second subparagraph of Article&nbsp;2(5) applies to such a  determination by the EU&nbsp;authorities. The Appellate Body also rejected  Argentina's claim that the Panel acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;11 of  the DSU in ascertaining the meaning of the second&nbsp;subparagraph of Article&nbsp;2(5)  of the Basic Regulation. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Regarding Argentina's claim under Article&nbsp;2.2 of the  Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement and Article&nbsp;VI:1(b)(ii) of the GATT&nbsp;1994,  the Appellate&nbsp;Body considered that the Panel did not err in finding that  the second subparagraph of Article&nbsp;2(5) of the Basic&nbsp;Regulation does  not require the EU&nbsp;authorities to establish the costs of production so as  to reflect costs prevailing in other countries outside the country of origin.  The Appellate&nbsp;Body also rejected Argentina's claim that the Panel acted  inconsistently with Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU in ascertaining the meaning of  the second&nbsp;subparagraph of Article&nbsp;2(5) of the Basic Regulation.  Furthermore, the Appellate&nbsp;Body found  that Argentina had not satisfied its burden of proving that the second subparagraph of  Article&nbsp;2(5) of the Basic&nbsp;Regulation restricts, in a material  way, the discretion of the EU&nbsp;authorities to construct the costs of  production in a manner consistent with Article&nbsp;2.2 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement  and Article&nbsp;VI:1(b)(ii) of the GATT&nbsp;1994. For these reasons, the  Appellate Body upheld the Panel's finding that Argentina had not established  that the second subparagraph of Article&nbsp;2(5) of the Basic&nbsp;Regulation  is inconsistent &ldquo;as such&rdquo; with Article&nbsp;2.2 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement  and Article&nbsp;VI:1(b)(ii) of the GATT&nbsp;1994.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Having upheld the Panel findings above, the Appellate Body  also upheld the Panel's consequential finding that Argentina had not  established that the second subparagraph of Article&nbsp;2(5) of the  Basic&nbsp;Regulation is inconsistent with Article&nbsp;XVI:4 of the  WTO&nbsp;Agreement and Article&nbsp;18.4 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement.</p>

<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 26 October 2016, the DSB adopted the  Appellate Body report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body  report.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
  <p class="paranormaltext">At the DSB  meeting on 23 November 2016, the European Union informed the DSB that, pursuant  to Article 21.3 of the DSU, it intended to implement the DSB's recommendations  and rulings in this dispute. On 9 December 2016, the European Union and Argentina informed the DSB that they had agreed that the reasonable period of time to implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings would be 9 months and 15 days. Accordingly, the reasonable period of time is set to expire on 10 August 2017. One day earlier, on 9 August  2017, the European Union and Argentina informed the DSB that they had agreed  that the reasonable period of time is to expire on 28 September 2017. In that  same communication, the parties also notified the DSB of Agreed Procedures  under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU (sequencing agreement).</p>
  <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Implementation of adopted reports </h3>
  <p> At the DSB meeting on 23 October 2017, the European Union  informed the DSB that the adoption of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1578  (amending the WTO-inconsistent anti-dumping measures on biodiesel) ensured  the  full implementation of the DSB recommendations and rulings in this dispute. Argentina  welcomed the EU status report and reiterated its satisfaction with the adoption  of the Implementing Regulation. Argentina further indicated that it was closely  monitoring the appeal brought to the European Court of Justice by the EU Commission  against the decision of the EU General Court annulling the imposition of a  definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of biodiesel of November 2013. In  addition, Argentina reiterated its serious concern about the European Biodiesel  Board's announcement of its intention to submit a petition to the EU Commission  to initiate a subsidy investigation against Argentinean biodiesel imports. </p>
