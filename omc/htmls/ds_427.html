        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the United States. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 20 September 2011, the United States requested  consultations with China concerning China's measures imposing anti-dumping and  countervailing duties on broiler products from the United&nbsp;States.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The United States claimed that the measures appear to  be inconsistent with various provisions of the Anti-Dumping Agreement related  to the process of the anti-dumping investigation as well as the anti-dumping  duty determination at issue (including improper dumping and injury  determination, improper reliance on the facts available, failure to provide  access to relevant information, insufficient explanation of the basis for the  determinations, absence of proper analysis of the effects of imports under  investigation, and absence of objective determination of causality).&nbsp; The United States alleges violations of  Articles&nbsp;1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 5.1, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.8, 6.9,  and 12.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The United States further claimed that the measures  appear to be inconsistent with various provisions of the SCM Agreement related  to the process of the subsidy investigation as well as the countervailing duty  determination at issue (including improper reliance on the facts available, insufficient  explanation of the basis for the determinations, and imposition of  countervailing duties in excess of the subsidy found to exist).&nbsp; The United States alleges violations of  Articles 10, 11.1, 12.3, 12.4, 12.7, 12.8, 15.1, 15.2, 15.4, 15.5, 16.1, 19.4,  22.3, 22.4, and 22.5 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The United States considered that the measures are also  inconsistent with Article VI of the GATT&nbsp;1994 as a consequence of the  alleged violations of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and SCM&nbsp;Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 8 December 2011, the United States requested the  establishment of a panel.&nbsp; At its meeting on 19 December 2011, the DSB  deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate  Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext">At  its meeting on 20 January 2012, the DSB established a panel.&nbsp; The European Union,  Japan, Norway, Saudi Arabia and  Thailand reserved their third party rights. Subsequently, Chile and Mexico reserved their  third party rights. On 14 May 2012, the United States requested the  Director&#8209;General to determine the composition of the panel.&nbsp; On 24 May 2012, the  Director-General composed the panel. On 23  November 2012, the Chairman of the panel notified  the DSB that it would not be able to issue its report within six months.&nbsp; The panel expects to  conclude its work by the end  of June 2013, consistent with the timetable adopted by the panel after  consultations with the parties to the dispute.</p>
        
              <p class="paranormaltext"><a name="bkmk427r" id="bkmk427r"></a>On 2  August 2013, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">The dispute  concerns China's imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing measures on  broiler chicken products from the United States. The United States challenged  before the Panel both the substantive analysis of China's Ministry of Commerce  (&ldquo;MOFCOM&rdquo;) under several provisions of the Anti-Dumping and SCM  Agreements and the GATT 1994, as well as the manner in which MOFCOM conducted  its investigations.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"><strong>United</strong><strong> States' claims on MOFCOM's  conduct of its investigations</strong>:</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> The United States  claimed that China acted inconsistently with Article 6.2 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement as, despite a specific request from the United States Government,  MOFCOM did not provide an opportunity for the interested parties with adverse  interests to meet and present their views. The Panel upheld the claim as it  found that no evidence on the record supported China's assertion that MOFCOM  had contacted these Chinese interested parties, and MOFCOM had taken no other  action to organize a meeting between the US Government and these parties. </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> The United States also  claimed that MOFCOM did not require non-confidential summaries of information in the Petition and thus hampered the US interested parties' ability to  defend their interests. The Panel upheld the United States' claims that to the  extent that the non-confidential version of the Petition constituted non-confidential  summaries, these summaries did not satisfy the requirement in Articles 6.5.1 of  the Anti-Dumping Agreement and 12.4.1 of the SCM Agreement to provide a  reasonable understanding of the information submitted in confidence.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> The United States  claimed that MOFCOM failed to disclose certain essential facts under Article  6.9 of the Anti-dumping Agreement to the individual US respondents and under  both Article 6.9 of the Anti-dumping and 12.8 of the SCM Agreement with respect  to the calculation of the &ldquo;all others&rdquo; rates. The Panel  upheld these claims. </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> <strong>United</strong><strong> States' claims on the  calculation of the anti-dumping and countervailing duties:</strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">
              The United States  claimed China acted inconsistently with Article 2.2.1.1 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement in its determination of the cost of production of the foreign like  product for the purposes of constructing normal value, by (i) improperly  rejecting the cost allocations kept in the normal books and records of the US  respondents; (ii) applying its own allocation methodology that did not reflect  the costs associated with the production and sale of the products under  consideration; and (iii) allocating the costs of producing certain products  (blood and feathers) to the other products one of the respondents produced. </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> The Panel upheld  the complaint, with respect to two of the US respondents, as it found no  explanation on the record for why MOFCOM rejected the cost allocations  contained in the respondents' normal books and records. For one respondent, the  Panel concluded that MOFCOM had provided a sufficient explanation of its  reasons for rejecting the cost allocations contained in the respondent's normal  books and records. </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> The Panel also  found that the allocation methodology MOFCOM adopted was inconsistent with  Article 2.2.1.1, because MOFCOM allocated processing costs to products that  were not actually associated with their production and sale. Finally, the Panel  found that China had not rebutted the United States' <em>prima facie</em> case that MOFCOM had allocated the costs of producing  certain products (blood and feathers) to the other products produced by the  particular respondent concerned.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> The United States  claimed that MOFCOM failed to make a fair comparison between export price and  normal value under Article 2.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement when it improperly  adjusted one respondent's export price to account for freezer storage expenses  incurred by that respondent. China objected to the United States' claim on the  grounds that Article 2.4 was not mentioned in the US request for consultations.  The Panel upheld China's objection and found that the United States' claim was  outside its terms of reference. </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> The United States  claimed that MOFCOM improperly calculated the amount of per unit subsidization  in the subject imports and as a result acted inconsistently with Articles 19.4  of the SCM Agreement and VI:3 of the GATT 1994. In particular, the United  States claimed that MOFCOM improperly allocated subsidies received for the  production of <em>all</em> chicken products  only to the production of <em>subject  products</em>. The Panel concluded MOFCOM had not explained how its subsidy  calculation ensured that it only countervailed those subsidies bestowed on the  production of subject products and thus upheld the United States' claim.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> <strong>United States' claims on the &ldquo;all  others&rdquo; rate</strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">
              The United States  claimed that China acted inconsistently with Article 6.8 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement and 12.7 of the SCM Agreement when it used &ldquo;facts  available&rdquo; to determine the anti-dumping and countervailing duty rates for  unknown US producers and exporters. Specifically, the United States argued that  MOFCOM could not apply facts available to unknown producers and exporters  because MOFCOM had failed to notify them of the initiation of the  investigations and of information required of them and of the fact that failure  on their part to provide that information would result in a determination based  on facts available. Furthermore, the United States argued that the rates  selected by MOFCOM were improper as they were significantly higher than the  rates of the investigated companies or those that had registered and not been investigated  and that MOFCOM had failed to explain how it had determined the rates. &nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">
              The Panel rejected  the United States' argument that MOFCOM had failed to fulfil the conditions for  resorting to facts available under Article 6.8 and Annex II. However, the Panel  concluded that the United States made a prima facie case, not rebutted by  China, that rates applied were in contravention of the two provisions. As a  result, the Panel upheld the United States' claims.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> <strong>United States' claims on the injury determinations: </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"><em>The definition of the &ldquo;domestic  industry&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">
              The United States claimed that MOFCOM improperly defined the domestic  industry, contrary to Article 4.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article  16.1 of the SCM Agreement, because MOFCOM did not seek to define the domestic  industry as the &ldquo;domestic producers as a whole&rdquo; before defining it as  those producers representing a &ldquo;major proportion&rdquo; of total domestic  production. The United States also claimed that MOFCOM's process for defining  the domestic industry involved a self-selection process introducing a  &ldquo;material risk of distortion&rdquo; into the injury analysis that was also  inconsistent with the obligations in Article 3.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement  and Article 15.1 of the SCM Agreement to conduct an objective examination of  injury based on positive evidence.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> The Panel  concluded that there was no obligation in Article 4.1 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement or Article 16.1 of the SCM Agreement to first attempt to define the  &ldquo;domestic industry&rdquo; as the domestic producers as a whole <em>before</em> an investigating authority can  define the domestic industry as those producers representing a &ldquo;major  proportion&rdquo; of total domestic production. As the obligation posited by the  United States did not actually exist, the Panel rejected the United States'  claim. The Panel also concluded that the United States had not adduced evidence  that MOFCOM's process for defining the domestic industry involved a  self-selection process that introduced a material risk of distortion into the  injury analysis. Therefore, the Panel found no inconsistency with either  Articles 4.1/ 16.1 or with Articles 3.1 /15.1. </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> <em>United States' claims with respect to MOFCOM's  price effects analysis</em></p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">
              The United States  claimed that MOFCOM's price effects analyses were inconsistent with Articles  3.1 and 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and 15.1 and 15.2 of the SCM  Agreement. The United States argued that MOFCOM's findings of price  undercutting resulted from a comparison of subject import and domestic average  unit values: (i) at different levels of trade; and (ii) included different  product mixes. The Panel upheld the United States' arguments with respect to  differences in product mix.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> The United States  also claimed that MOFCOM's finding of price suppression in each of the investigations  were inconsistent with the same provisions, because they were based on the  WTO-inconsistent finding of price undercutting. &nbsp;The Panel upheld the claims.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> <em>United States' claims on other aspects of the  injury determinations</em> </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> The Panel exercised judicial  economy with respect to the United States' claims regarding MOFCOM's analyses  of the &ldquo;impact&rdquo; of subject imports on the domestic industry and on  MOFCOM's causation analyses. </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> <strong>United States' claims on </strong><strong>the</strong><strong> sufficiency of the public notices</strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">
              The United States claimed that MOFCOM's public  notice of the Preliminary and Final Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duty Determinations were inconsistent with the requirement in Articles 12.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement and 22.3 of the SCM Agreement to disclose &ldquo;the  findings and conclusions reached on all issues of fact and law considered  material by the investigating authorities&rdquo;. </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> The Panel upheld the claim with respect to the  Final Determinations and exercised judicial economy with respect to the  Preliminary Determinations.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> Furthermore, the United States claimed that  the public notices of the Final Determination were also inconsistent with Articles 12.2 and 12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and  Articles 22.3 and 22.5 of the SCM Agreement, because they failed to explain the  reasons for MOFCOM's rejection of the arguments of the US industry association  during the investigations, that (1) US imports had taken market share from  third country imports, not the domestic industry; and (2) that the effect that  US imports of paws (which accounted for 40% of subject imports) could not  injure the Chinese domestic industry as that industry was unable to satisfy  demand for paws. </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> The Panel rejected the claim with respect to  the first argument, but upheld the claim with respect to the  second argument. </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> Finally, the United  States made an additional claim under Articles 12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement and 22.5 of the SCM Agreement with respect to MOFCOM's failure to  explain, in its public notice of the Final AD and CVD Determinations, the  reason for its rejection of the US argument on &ldquo;level of trade&rdquo;. </p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> The Panel rejected an objection by China that the claims fell outside its terms of  reference because they were not identified in the request for establishment of  a panel, and upheld the US claim on the merits. </p>

<h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
<p align="left" class="paranormaltext">  
  On  22 October 2013, China  informed the DSB that it intended to implement the DSB  recommendations and rulings in a manner that respects its WTO obligations and  that they would need a reasonable period of time to do so. On 19 December 2013, China and the United States  informed the DSB that they had agreed that the reasonable period of time for China to  implement the DSB recommendations and rulings shall be 9 months, 14 days  from the date of adoption of the panel report. Accordingly, the reasonable period of time expired   on 9 July 2014. At the DSB meeting of 22 July 2014, China informed  the DSB that it had fully implemented the DSB recommendations and rulings.&nbsp; The United States disagreed with China's  assertion that it had fully complied.</p>

<h3> Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
<p align="left" class="paranormaltext"> On 15 July 2014,  China and the  United States informed the DSB of Agreed Procedures under  Articles&nbsp;21 and 22 of the DSU. </p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Compliance  proceedings </h3>
<p class="paranormaltext"> On  10 May 2016, the United States requested consultations pursuant to Article 21.5  of the DSU, in connection with China's measures continuing to impose antidumping  and countervailing duties on broiler products from the United States. On 27 May  2016, the United States requested, pursuant to Article 21.5 of the DSU, the  establishment of a compliance panel. At its meeting on 22 June 2016, the DSB  agreed to refer to the original panel, if possible, the matter raised by the United  States. Brazil,  Ecuador,  the European Union, and Japan reserved their third party  rights. On  18&nbsp;July&nbsp;2016, the compliance panel was composed.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 18 October 2016, the Chairperson of  the panel informed the DSB that the panel expected to issue its report before  the end of 2017.</p>
           <p class="paranormaltext" id="bkmk427rw"><a  name="bkmk427rw"></a>On 18  January 2018, the compliance panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

    	      <p>In the compliance proceeding, the United States challenged measures  taken by China to comply with the rulings and recommendations of the DSB in the  original dispute. Following the original report of the Panel, MOFCOM conducted  a reinvestigation. Based on a redetermination, it continued to impose anti-dumping  and countervailing duties on imports of broiler products from the United  States.</p>
    	      <p>In a preliminary ruling, the Panel found that US claims under Articles  6.1.2 and 6.2 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement and Article 12.2 of the SCM  Agreement fell outside of the Panel's terms of reference. It rejected  jurisdictional objections to other claims.</p>
    	      <p>On the merits, the Panel then upheld most of the US claims in its  Report.</p>
    	      <p><strong>Claims concerning the  calculation of the anti-dumping duties</strong></p>
    	      <p>The United States challenged MOFCOM's allocation of costs in  constructing normal value under the second sentence of Article 2.2.1.1 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement because MOFCOM had used two&nbsp;different cost  allocation methodologies for different parts of the chicken. The Panel found  that this provision does not, as a general matter, require an investigating  authority to use the same cost allocation methodology in every instance a cost  allocation is necessary in an investigation. It also found that the United  States had not established that this provision required MOFCOM to use the same  cost allocation methodology in the particular circumstances of this case. To  the extent that an investigating authority uses more than one cost allocation  methodology in calculating costs of production for purposes of determining  normal value, it must, however, adequately explain the basis for this approach.  In respect of one particular US exporter, the Panel therefore found that China  acted inconsistently with the second sentence of Article 2.2.1.1 because:</p>
<ul>    	      
   	      <li>MOFCOM did not explain why the  concern &ndash; that allocations must &ldquo;reasonably reflect costs&rdquo; of  production &mdash; it had relied upon to choose a weight-based cost allocation for  subject product models nonetheless allowed for the exclusion of certain parts  of a live broiler (feathers, blood, and viscera) that were necessarily part of  the production of the subject broiler product models from its cost allocation;  and<br>&nbsp;</li>
    	      <li>MOFCOM did not provide a  reasoned and adequate explanation for its rejection of the exporter's  alternative weight-based cost allocation methodology.</li>
    	      </ul>
<p>In respect of another US exporter, the Panel found that China acted  inconsistently with the second sentence of Article 2.2.1.1 because China did  not in any way address the implementation obligation that arose in respect of  this exporter from the Panel's original finding of inconsistency under the same  provision.</p>
<p>The United States also challenged MOFCOM's rejection of certain cost  data provided by one investigated US producer and the decision to use facts  available. The Panel concluded that China acted inconsistently with Article 6.8  and paragraph 3 of Annex II. MOFCOM had neither considered the criteria in paragraph  3 nor linked its decision to reject the reported data to any assessment of  those criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Claims concerning the  injury determination</strong></p>
<p><em>Claims concerning the price  effects analysis</em></p>
<p>In the original report, the Panel had found that China acted  inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and 15.1  and 15.2 of the SCM Agreement. MOFCOM had relied for its findings of price  undercutting on a comparison of subject import and domestic average unit values  that included different product mixes <em>without</em> taking any steps to control for differences in physical characteristics  affecting price comparability or making necessary adjustments. In these  compliance proceedings, the Panel found that China also acted inconsistently  with the same provisions. In respect of MOFCOM's findings of price undercutting  in the redetermination, it held that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MOFCOM did not redo the price  comparison but undertook a &ldquo;reverification&rdquo; in which it collected and  analysed additional pricing information from four domestic Chinese producers  during the reinvestigation. This &ldquo;reverification&rdquo; did not suffice to  bring China's measure into conformity with its obligations under Articles 3.2  of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and 15.2 of the SCM Agreement, in that it failed  to address the comparability of average unit values derived from different  baskets of products for the purpose of considering the effects of prices of  subject imports on domestic like product prices; and<br>&nbsp;</li>

  <li>In conducting its  &ldquo;reverification&rdquo;, MOFCOM failed to explain in what way the four  domestic Chinese producers chosen were &ldquo;representative&rdquo; such that a  consideration of price effects based on data for these companies could be  generalised to the domestic industry.</li>
  </ul>
<p>The Panel also held that MOFCOM's consideration of price suppression  rested on its consideration of price undercutting, such that its price  suppression analysis was undermined by a flawed analysis of price undercutting.</p>
<p><em>Claims concerning the impact  analysis</em></p>
<p>Concerning MOFCOM's examination of the impact on the domestic  industry, the Panel found that China acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and  3.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Articles&nbsp;15.1 and 15.4 of the SCM  Agreement because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MOFCOM's evaluation of  &ldquo;capacity utilization rates&rdquo; was faulty in that it did not take into  account the expansion of capacity; and<br>&nbsp;</li>

  <li>MOFCOM relied on an irrelevant  economic factor when it examined the impact of likely future imports on  &ldquo;potential decline&rdquo; in the domestic industry.</li>
  </ul>
<p><em>Claims concerning the  causation analysis</em></p>
<p>In respect of MOFCOM's causation analysis, the Panel found that  China acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.5 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement and Articles 15.1 and 15.5 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. In its demonstration  of a causal link between the subject imports and injury to the domestic  industry, MOFCOM relied on a defective consideration of price effects.</p>
<p><strong>Claims concerning the  conduct of the investigation</strong></p>
<p>The United States also challenged MOFCOM's procedure in collecting  additional pricing information from the four domestic Chinese producers during  the reinvestigation. The Panel found that MOFCOM did not give notice to the US  interested parties of the information that MOFCOM required from the domestic  Chinese producers, contrary to the requirements of Article 6.1 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping  Agreement and Article 12.1 of the SCM Agreement. It also held that MOFCOM  failed to provide US interested parties timely opportunities to see MOFCOM's  requests for information to the domestic Chinese producers, contrary to the  requirements of Article 6.4 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping&nbsp;Agreement and Article 12.3  of the SCM Agreement. </p>
<p><strong>Other claims</strong></p>
    	    <p>The Panel rejected the US claims under  Articles 6.9 and 9.4(i) of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. The Panel found that the  United States had not established its claim that MOFCOM did not inform the US  interested parties of the essential facts in respect of their dumping margin  calculations and the respective underlying data from the original investigation  and the reinvestigation. It also did not consider that MOFCOM was, as the  United States argued, under an obligation to allow &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; exporters that had not registered for the original investigation to participate  in the reinvestigation. The Panel therefore rejected the US position that in  the circumstances of this case MOFCOM was precluded in the reinvestigation from  establishing a &ldquo;residual&rdquo; duty rate based on facts available for all  other &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; exporters without regard to the limitation set forth  in Article&nbsp;9.4(i) of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </p>
