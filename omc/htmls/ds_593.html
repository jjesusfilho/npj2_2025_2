        <h3>Consultations</h3>
         <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Indonesia</strong></p>
        <p align="left">On 9 December 2019, Indonesia requested  consultations with the European Union regarding certain measures imposed by the  European Union and its member States concerning palm oil and oil palm  crop-based biofuels from Indonesia. </p>
        <p align="left">Indonesia claimed that the measures imposed by the  European Union appear to be inconsistent with: </p>
         <ul>
           <li>Articles 2.1,  2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 2.8, 2.9, 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.2, 5.6, 5.8, 12.1 and 12.3 of the TBT  Agreement; and<br>
&nbsp;           </li>
           <li>Articles  I:1, III:4, X:3(a) and XI:1 of the GATT 1994.</li>
         </ul>
         <p align="left">Indonesia claimed that the measures imposed by the  European Union member States appear to be inconsistent with: </p>
         <ul>
           <li>Articles  3.1(b) and 5 of the SCM Agreement; and<br>
&nbsp;           </li>
           <li>Articles  I:1 and III:2 of the GATT 1994.</li>
         </ul>
        <p align="left">On 19 December 2019, Costa Rica and Guatemala  requested to join the consultations. On  20&nbsp;December 2019, Colombia requested to join the consultations. On 23  December 2019, Malaysia requested to join the consultations. On 24 December  2019, Argentina requested to join the consultations. On 26 December 2019,  Thailand requested to join the consultations. Subsequently, the European Union informed the DSB that it  had accepted the requests of Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Malaysia, and  Thailand to join the consultations.</p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
         <h3>Panel  and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
         <p align="left">On 18 March 2020, Indonesia requested  the establishment of a panel. At its  meeting on 29 June 2020, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 29 July 2020, the DSB established a  panel. Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador,  Guatemala, Honduras, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Norway, Russia, Singapore,  Thailand, Turkey and the United States reserved their third-party rights.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 2  November 2020, Indonesia requested that the composition of the panel be  determined pursuant to Article 8.7 of the DSU. On 12 November 2020, Deputy  Director-General Yonov Frederick Agah, acting in place of the Director-General,  composed the panel.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 8 June 2021,  the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that in accordance with the timetable  adopted by the panel, after consultations with the parties, the panel estimated  to issue its final report to the parties not before the second quarter of 2022.  The Chair apprised the DSB that the report would be available to the public  once it was circulated to the Members in all three official languages, and that  the date of circulation depends on completion of translation. On  22 February 2023, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that in light of the  complexity of the legal and factual issues that had  arisen in the dispute, the panel expected to issue  its final report to the parties not before the third quarter of 2023.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 5 March 2024, the Chair of the panel informed the  DSB that the panel had granted Indonesia's request of 4 March 2024 that the  panel suspend its work pursuant to Article 12.12 of the DSU for a period of two  months. Subsequently,  the Chair informed the DSB of several requests from Indonesia to extend the  suspension of the panel's work. In its most recent communication, dated  8 November 2024, the Chair informed  the DSB that the panel had granted Indonesia's request of  6  November 2024 to extend the suspension of the panel's work until  9 January 2025. The Chair indicated  that the panel would resume its work and circulate the panel report on  10  January  2025. </p>

    	    <p>With regard to the EU measures at issue,  the Panel found that:</p>
    	      <ul>
    	                    <li>the 7% maximum  share and the high ILUC-risk cap and phase-out were technical regulations  within the meaning of Annex&nbsp;1.1 to the TBT&nbsp;Agreement; </li>
    	                    <li>Indonesia failed  to establish that the 7% maximum share and the high ILUC-risk cap and phase-out  were inconsistent with the obligation in Article 2.4 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement  to use relevant international standards as a basis for technical regulations; </li>
    	                    <li>Indonesia failed  to establish that the 7% maximum share and the high ILUC-risk cap and phase-out  were inconsistent with the obligation in Article 2.2 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement  to ensure that technical regulations are not more trade-restrictive than  necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective;</li>
    	                    <li>the European  Union administered the high ILUC-risk cap and phase-out inconsistently with  Article 2.1 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement by failing to conduct a timely review of  the data used to determine which biofuels were high ILUC risk, and because  there were deficiencies in the design and implementation of the low ILUC-risk  criteria, which resulted in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between  countries where the same conditions prevail;</li>
    	                    <li>Indonesia had not established that the European Union  acted inconsistently with Article 2.5 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement by failing to  explain the justification for preparing, adopting or applying the high  ILUC-risk cap and phase-out in terms of Articles 2.2 to 2.4 of the  TBT&nbsp;Agreement; </li>
    	                    <li>Indonesia failed  to establish that the high ILUC-risk cap and phase-out was inconsistent with  the obligation in Article 2.8 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement to whenever appropriate  specify technical regulations in terms of performance rather than design or  descriptive characteristics;</li>
    	                    <li>regarding the  claims under Article 2.9 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement, the European Union acted  inconsistently with: (i) Article 2.9.2 by failing to notify the proposed 7%  maximum share and the proposed high ILUC-risk cap and phase-out measures; and (ii)  Article 2.9.4 by having failed to organize a commenting process in respect of  the proposed 7% maximum share and the proposed high ILUC-risk cap and phase-out  measures in accordance with the requirements of that provision;</li>
    	                    <li>the low  ILUC-risk certification procedure was a &ldquo;conformity assessment  procedure&rdquo; within the meaning of Annex&nbsp;1.3 to the TBT&nbsp;Agreement; </li>
    	                    <li>Indonesia failed  to establish that the low ILUC-risk certification procedure was inconsistent  with the obligation in Article 5.1.1 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement to ensure that  conformity assessment procedures grant access for suppliers of like products  originating in the territories of other Members under conditions no less  favourable than those accorded to suppliers of like products of national origin  or originating in any other country; </li>
    	                    <li>the low  ILUC-risk certification procedure as set out in Article 6 of the Delegated  Regulation was inconsistent with Article 5.1.2 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement since  deficiencies in the implementation of the low ILUC-risk procedure had created  unnecessary obstacles to international trade;</li>
    	                    <li>Indonesia failed  to establish that the European Union acted inconsistently with the obligation  in Article 5.2.1 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement to ensure that conformity assessment  procedures are undertaken and completed as expeditiously as possible;</li>
    	                    <li>regarding the  claims under Article 5.6 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement, the European Union acted  inconsistently with: (i) Article 5.6.1 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement by failing to  publish a notice of the proposed low ILUC-risk certification procedure at an  early appropriate stage in such a manner as to enable interested parties in  Indonesia and other WTO Members to become acquainted with it; (ii) Article  5.6.2 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement by failing to notify the proposed low ILUC-risk  certification procedure; and (iii) Article 5.6.4 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement by  having failed to organize a commenting process in respect of the proposed low  ILUC-risk certification procedure in accordance with the requirements of that  provision;</li>
    	                    <li>it was  unnecessary to rule on Indonesia's alternative claim that the European Union  acted inconsistently with the obligation in Article 5.8 of the  TBT&nbsp;Agreement to ensure that conformity assessment procedures which have  been adopted are published promptly or otherwise made available in such a  manner as to enable interested parties in other Members to become acquainted  with them;</li>
    	                    <li>Indonesia failed to  establish that the European Union acted inconsistently with Article 12.3 or  12.1 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement; </li>
    	                    <li>Indonesia  had not established that the high ILUC-risk cap and phase-out was inconsistent  with the obligation in Article XI:1 of the GATT&nbsp;1994 to not institute or  maintain any prohibitions or restrictions on the importation of any product of  the territory of another Member;</li>

                            <li>the high  ILUC-risk cap and phase-out was inconsistent with Article III:4 of the  GATT&nbsp;1994 because it accorded less favourable treatment to palm oil-based  biofuel from Indonesia than that accorded to like products of EU origin; </li>
                            <li>the high  ILUC-risk cap and phase-out was inconsistent with Article I:1 of the  GATT&nbsp;1994 because it did not accord an advantage to palm oil-based biofuel  from Indonesia that was accorded to like products imported from third  countries;</li>
                            <li>the European  Union acted inconsistently with Article X:3(a) of the GATT&nbsp;1994 by  administering the high ILUC-risk cap and phase-out in Article 26 of RED II in a  manner that was not reasonable, to the extent that deficiencies in the design  and implementation of the low ILUC-risk criteria and procedure did not provide  for the elements needed for palm oil-based biofuel to be certified as low  ILUC-risk;</li>
                            <li>with respect to  Article XX of the GATT&nbsp;1994: (i) the high ILUC-risk cap and phase-out was  a measure relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources that was  made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic consumption or  production within the meaning of Article XX(g); (ii) the high ILUC-risk cap and  phase-out was a measure necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or  health within the meaning of Article XX(b); (iii) it was unnecessary to rule on  whether the high ILUC-risk cap and phase-out was a measure necessary to protect  public morals under Article XX(a); and (iv) the high ILUC-risk cap and  phase-out had been administered in a manner that constituted arbitrary or  unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions  prevail, because the European Union failed to conduct a timely review of the  data used to determine which biofuels were high ILUC risk, and because there were  deficiencies in the design and implementation of the low ILUC-risk criteria and  certification procedure;</li>

              </ul>
              <p>With  regard to the French TIRIB measure, the Panel found that:</p>
              <ul>
                            <li>by excluding  palm oil-based biofuel from the group of qualifying biofuels, the French TIRIB  measure was inconsistent with Article III:2, first sentence of the  GATT&nbsp;1994, because it resulted in the application of internal taxes to  imported palm oil-based biofuel in excess of those applied to the like domestic  rapeseed and soybean oil crop-based biofuels;</li>
                            <li>by excluding  palm oil-based biofuel from the group of qualifying biofuels, the French TIRIB  measure was inconsistent with Article III:2, second sentence of the  GATT&nbsp;1994, because it resulted in dissimilar taxation between imported  palm oil-based biofuel and the directly competitive or substitutable domestic  rapeseed and soybean oil crop-based biofuels, and this dissimilar taxation was  applied so as to afford protection to domestic production;</li>
                            <li>by excluding  palm oil-based biofuel from the group of qualifying biofuels, the French TIRIB  measure was inconsistent with Article I:1 of the GATT&nbsp;1994, because it  granted an advantage to imported rapeseed and soybean oil crop-based biofuels  that was not immediately and unconditionally accorded to like palm oil-based  biofuel imported from Indonesia;</li>
                            <li>with respect to  Article XX of the GATT&nbsp;1994: (i) the exclusion of palm oil-based biofuel  from the group of qualifying biofuels for the purposes of the French TIRIB  measure was a measure relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural  resources that was made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic  consumption or production within the meaning of Article XX(g); (ii) the  exclusion of palm oil-based biofuel from the group of qualifying biofuels for  the purposes of the French TIRIB measure was a measure necessary to protect  human, animal or plant life or health within the meaning of Article XX(b); (iii)  it was unnecessary to rule on whether the exclusion of palm oil-based biofuel  from the group of qualifying biofuels for the purposes of the French TIRIB  measure was a measure necessary to protect public morals under Article XX(a);  and (iv) the exclusion of palm oil-based biofuel from the group of qualifying  biofuels for the purposes of the French TIRIB measure had been administered in  a manner that constituted arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between  countries where the same conditions prevail because the European Union failed  to conduct a timely review of the data used to determine which biofuels were  high ILUC risk, and had failed to demonstrate the existence of any provisions  or flexibilities for palm oil-based biofuels to be certified as low ILUC-risk;  and</li>
                            <li>Indonesia failed  to establish that the French TIRIB measure provided a prohibited subsidy within  the meaning of Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement, or in the  alternative a specific subsidy that caused adverse effects in the form of  serious prejudice or a threat thereof under Articles 5(c), 6.3(a) and 6.3(c) of  the SCM&nbsp;Agreement.</li>
