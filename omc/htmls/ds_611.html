        <h3>Consultations</h3>
         <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the European Union </strong></p>
        <p>On 18 February 2022, the European Union requested  consultations with China with regard to measures that allegedly adversely  affect the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. <br>
           The European Union claimed that the measures at  issue appear to be inconsistent with: </p>
         <ul>
           <li>Articles  1.1, 28.1,  28.2, 41.1, and 44.1 of the TRIPS Agreement; and <br>
&nbsp;           </li>
           <li>Section  2(A)(2) of China's Accession Protocol.</li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left">The European Union also claimed that:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>by  failing to publish certain judicial decisions regarding the measures at issue,  China appears to have acted in a manner inconsistent with its obligations in  Article 63.1 of the TRIPS Agreement; and <br>
&nbsp;           </li>
           <li>by failing  to supply to the European Union information about three judicial decisions  related to the measures at issue that the European Union had requested, China  appears to have acted in a manner inconsistent with its obligations under  Article 63.3 of the TRIPS Agreement. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On  4 March  2022, Canada,  Japan and the United  States requested to join the consultations.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and  Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p> On 7 December  2022, the European Union requested the establishment of a panel. At  its meeting on 20 December 2022, the DSB deferred the establishment of the panel.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">At  its meeting on 27 January 2023, the DSB established a panel. Australia, Brazil,  Canada, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Norway, Peru, the Russian  Federation, Singapore, Switzerland, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, Ukraine, the United  Kingdom, the United States, and Viet Nam reserved their third-party rights.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">Following the agreement of the  parties, the panel was composed on 28 March 2023.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 4 July 2023,  the European Union and China informed the DSB that they had agreed to  Procedures for Arbitration under Article 25 of the DSU in this dispute (&ldquo;Agreed  Arbitration Procedures&rdquo;). Such  procedures were entered into by the European Union and China to give effect to  the communication JOB/DSB/1/Add.12 (&ldquo;Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration  Arrangement Pursuant to  Article 25 of the  DSU (MPIA)&rdquo;) and with the objective of setting a framework for an Arbitrator to  decide on any appeal from any final panel report issued in this dispute, if the  Appellate Body is not able to hear such an appeal under Articles 16.4 and 17 of  the DSU.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 2 November  2023, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that, in  accordance with the panel's timetable adopted following consultations with the  parties, taking into account the parties' availability due to other commitments,  the panel estimated that it would issue its final report to the parties not  before the second half of 2024. The Chair apprised the DSB that the report  would be available to the public once it was circulated to the Members in all  three official languages, and that the date of circulation depended on  completion of translation. On  11 December 2024, the Chair of the panel informed  the DSB that, due to a combination of factors including logistics and the time  required for thorough scrutinity of the many exhibits, the panel now expected  to issue its final report to the parties by the end of  the first quarter of 2025.</p>
<p align="left">On 21 February 2025,  the panel, having consulted with the parties, adopted Additional Working  Procedures to facilitate arbitration under Article 25 of the DSU  (&ldquo;Additional Working Procedures&rdquo;). On the same day, the panel issued  its final report to the parties and informed them that the panel report would  be circulated to Members, following translation, on 10 April 2025. </p>
<p align="left"> Further to a  request by the European Union to suspend its  work in  accordance with Article 12.12 of the DSU with a view to initiating arbitration  under the Agreed Arbitration Procedures, the panel granted the suspension,  effective on 2 April 2025. The Panel further decided not to circulate  its final report to Members unless it was subsequently requested to resume its  work within the time-period specified in Article 12.12 of the DSU. </p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Arbitration  under Article 25 of the DSU</h3>
<p> On 22 April 2025, the European Union filed a notice  of recourse to Article 25 under the Agreed Arbitration Procedures. This notice,  which the parties referred  to as a &ldquo;Notice of Appeal&rdquo;, was circulated to the DSB on  24 April 2025. It included the  full text of the panel  report in the three  official languages, transmitted by  the panel to the parties, third parties, and the pool of arbitrators and,  absent circulation by the panel to  Members, thereby made the panel report public.       </p>
<p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="art25" name="art25"></a>The  following is a summary of the panel report as included in the European Union's Notice  of Appeal:</p>

          <h4 class=""><a aria-controls="collapseA" aria-expanded="false" class="collapsed" data-parent="#accordion" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseA" role="button">Summary of key findings</a></h4>
      </div>
      <div aria-labelledby="headingOne" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseA" role="tabpanel">
          <div class="panel-body">
    	    <p align="left"><strong>Factual  background:</strong></p>
            <p>If  a technical standard requires the use of a patent-protected product or process  (i.e. a standard essential patent (SEP)), a producer implementing that standard  will need to obtain a licence for its use or risk infringing upon patent  owners' rights and the attendant legal consequences of doing so. As part of a  SEP holder's patent being included in a standard, the SEP holder typically  commits to license the subject matter of the patent to implementers of the  standard on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. This is  known as a FRAND undertaking.</p>
            <p>Legal  disputes may arise between patent holders and implementers as to whether a  particular royalty rate paid by the implementer to the patent holder is FRAND.  This may result in domestic litigation in the territories in which the product  or process is protected by a patent. As patents are territorial, multiple  jurisdictions may be implicated in disputes between parties on the FRAND rate. </p>
            <p>Several  implementers filed lawsuits in China asking Chinese courts to set the FRAND  licensing rate for certain patents required to produce mobile  telecommunications products and requesting anti-suit injunctions (ASIs) prohibiting  the other party from taking certain legal actions in other jurisdictions. Beginning in  August 2020 with a decision from the Supreme People's Court of China (SPC),  ASIs were issued in five cases before Chinese courts (and denied in one). </p>
            <p>Before  the Panel, the European Union challenged the five court decisions granting an  ASI, as well as an alleged unwritten ASI policy in SEP litigation. The European  Union claimed that China's measures were inconsistent with certain of China's  obligations under the TRIPS Agreement and that China failed to comply with the  transparency obligations in the TRIPS Agreement. Additionally, the European  Union claimed that the five Chinese court decisions granting ASIs were also  inconsistent with China's obligation under its Accession Protocol to apply its  laws, regulations, and other measures in a uniform, impartial, and reasonable  manner. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>The  Panel's key findings</strong></p>
            <p>With  respect to the unwritten ASI policy, the Panel found that (1) it was properly  within its terms of reference, and that (2) the European Union had proved its  existence. As to the consistency of the ASI policy with the  TRIPS&nbsp;Agreement, the Panel found that the European Union had not  demonstrated an inconsistency with: Article 28.1, whether or not read in  conjunction with Article 1.1, first sentence (concerning certain exclusive  rights of patent holders); Article 28.2 read in conjunction with Article&nbsp;1.1,  first sentence (concerning patent holders' right to licence their patents);  Article 41.1 (concerning intellectual property enforcement procedures); and  Article 44.1, first sentence, read in conjunction with Article 1.1, first  sentence (concerning injunctions). In particular, the Panel found that the  obligation in Article 1.1, first sentence stating that Members must &ldquo;give  effect&rdquo; to the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement requires Members to  implement the provisions of the TRIPS&nbsp;Agreement within their own domestic legal systems. The Panel concluded that  Article 1.1, first sentence contains no additional obligation relating to  frustrating the object and purpose of the TRIPS&nbsp;Agreement or other WTO  Members' implementation of the TRIPS&nbsp;Agreement.</p>
            <p align="left">With respect to the consistency  of the five individual Chinese court decisions granting ASIs with the TRIPS  Agreement, the European Union had advanced identical claims and arguments as  those raised with respect to the ASI policy. The Panel therefore declined to  make findings on these claims concerning the five individual decisions, as any  findings would be duplicative of the findings on the ASI policy.</p>
            <p align="left">With respect to the transparency  obligations under the TRIPS&nbsp;Agreement, the Panel found that China had  acted inconsistently with the publication obligation in Article 63.1 of the  TRIPS Agreement by failing to publish the decision issuing an ASI in Xiaomi v.  InterDigital, read together with the reconsideration decision in the same case.  The Panel found that China was not prepared to supply information requested by  the European Union and had thus acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;63.3,  first sentence. The Panel found that the European Union's claim with respect to  the provision of specific judicial decisions under Article 63.3, second  sentence was outside its terms of reference.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">Finally,  with respect to the European Union's claims that the five ASI decisions by  Chinese courts were inconsistent with Section 2(A)(2) of China's Accession  Protocol, the Panel found that the European Union had not demonstrated that  Chinese courts had applied China's laws, regulations, or other measures in a  non-uniform, not impartial, or unreasonable manner.</p>

    	    <p>The  European Union challenged aspects of the Panel's findings with respect to  Article 1.1, first sentence of the TRIPS Agreement and also challenged the  Panel's findings with respect to Articles 28.1, 28.2, and 44.1 read in  conjunction with Article 1.1, first sentence, as well as Article 41.1 of the  TRIPS Agreement.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>With  respect to <strong>Article 1.1, first sentence</strong>, the arbitrators considered  that the Panel <u>erred</u> in its interpretation of the obligation in Article  1.1, first sentence to &ldquo;give effect&rdquo; to the provisions of the TRIPS  Agreement in a WTO Member's&nbsp;territory, and <u>found</u> that the corollary  of that obligation is to do so without frustrating the functioning of the  systems of protection and enforcement of IP rights implemented by other Members  in their respective territories.</li>
              <li>With respect to <strong>Article 28.1, read in  conjunction with Article 1.1, first sentence</strong>, the arbitrators considered  that the Panel <u>erred</u> in finding that this obligation is limited to  ensuring a patent owner's exclusive rights in each Member's domestic legal  system and nothing more. Instead, the arbitrators <u>found</u> that Article  28.1, read in conjunction with Article&nbsp;1.1, first sentence, requires that  Members not frustrate a patent owner's ability to exercise the exclusive rights  conferred on it by another WTO Member under that provision, i.e. to prevent  third parties not having the patent owner's consent from making, using,  offering for sale, selling, or importing the patented product. The arbitrators considered  the European Union's request to complete the analysis with respect to ASI  policy and <u>found</u> that the European Union had demonstrated that the ASI  policy is inconsistent with Article 28.1, read in conjunction with Article 1.1,  first sentence.</li>
              <li>With respect to <strong>Article 28.2, read in  conjunction with Article 1.1, first sentence</strong>, the arbitrators considered  that the Panel <u>erred</u> in finding that this obligation is limited to  ensuring a patent owner's &ldquo;right&hellip; to conclude licensing contracts&rdquo; in  each Member's domestic legal system and nothing more. Instead, the arbitrators <u>found</u> that Article 28.2, read in conjunction with Article 1.1, first sentence,  requires that Members not frustrate a patent owner's ability to exercise its  &ldquo;right&hellip; to conclude licensing contracts&rdquo; as conferred in the  territory of another WTO Member under that provision. The arbitrators considered  the European Union's request to complete the analysis with respect to ASI  policy and <u>found</u> that the European Union had demonstrated that the ASI  policy is inconsistent with Article 28.2, read in conjunction with Article 1.1,  first sentence.</li>
              <li>With respect to <strong>Article 44.1, read in  conjunction with Article 1.1, first sentence</strong>, the arbitrators <u>upheld</u> the Panel's finding, albeit for  different reasons, that the European Union had not demonstrated that the  ASI policy is inconsistent with Article  44.1, read in conjunction with Article 1.1, first sentence.</li>
              <li>With respect to <strong>Article 41.1</strong>, the  arbitrators <u>upheld</u> the Panel's finding that the obligation in the second  sentence of Article 41.1 is not applicable to the ASI policy, as the ASI policy  is not an enforcement procedure as specified in Part&nbsp;III of the TRIPS Agreement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>China challenged the Panel's application of the legal  standard for the existence of an unwritten measure with respect to the ASI  policy, and also challenged the Panel's finding with respect to the case Xiaomi  v. InterDigital under Article 63.1 of the TRIPS Agreement.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>With respect to <strong>the Panel's application of  the legal standard for the existence of an unwritten measure</strong>, the  arbitrators <u>upheld</u> the Panel's finding that the European&nbsp;Union had provided  sufficient evidence and argumentation to demonstrate the existence of the ASI  policy and that its specific nature is that of a rule or norm of general and  prospective application.</li>
              <li>With respect to <strong>Article 63.1</strong>, the  arbitrators <u>upheld</u> the Panel's finding that the decision issuing an ASI in Xiaomi v.  InterDigital, read together with the reconsideration decision in the same case,  is a judicial decision &quot;of general application&quot; within the meaning of  Article 63.1 of the TRIPS Agreement. </li>
