        <h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Guatemala.&nbsp; (See also <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds415_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS415</a>, <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds417_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS417</a> and  <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds418_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS418</a>) </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 15 October 2010, Guatemala requested  consultations with the Dominican Republic concerning the provisional and  definitive safeguard measures imposed by the Dominican Republic on imports of  polypropylene bags and tubular fabric and the investigation that led to the  imposition of those measures.&nbsp; The  products at issue are classified under subheadings 5407.20.20, 6305.33.10 and  6305.33.90 of the Dominican Republic General Tariff.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> Guatemala is concerned about certain  aspects of the safeguard measures and the underlying investigation.&nbsp; In particular, Guatemala alleges that  these measures appear to be inconsistent with Articles 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1(a),  4.1(c), 4.2(a), 4.2(b), 4.2(c), 5.1, 6, 9.1, 11.1(a) and 12.3 of the Agreement  on Safeguards, and Article XIX:1(a) of the GATT 1994.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 22 October 2010, Panama requested to join the  consultations.&nbsp; On 26 October 2010, Costa Rica, Honduras and  El&nbsp;Salvador requested to join the consultations. Subsequently,  the Dominican Republic informed the DSB that it had accepted the requests of  Costa Rica, El&nbsp;Salvador, Honduras and Panama to join the consultations. On 15 December  2010, Guatemala requested the establishment of a panel. At  its meeting on 25&nbsp;January 2011, the DSB deferred the establishment of a  panel.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 7 February 2011, the DSB agreed to  establish a single panel, pursuant to Article&nbsp;9.1 of the DSU, to examine  this complaint and also DS415, DS417 and DS418.&nbsp;  China, Colombia, the European Union, Panama, Nicaragua, Turkey and the  United States reserved their third party rights. Subsequently,  Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras reserved their third party rights. On  1 March 2011, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras jointly requested  the Director-General to determine the composition of the panel.&nbsp; On 11 March 2011, the Director&#8209;General  composed the panel.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 6 September 2011, the Chairman of the panel  informed the DSB that the timetable adopted by the panel after consultations  with the parties to the dispute envisaged that the final report shall be issued  to parties by 11 November 2011.&nbsp;The panel expected to conclude its work within  that timeframe.&nbsp; On 21 November 2011, the  Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that, after having consulted with the  parties, the panel decided that it would issue its final report to the parties  on 23 November 2011. &nbsp;The final report  would be circulated to Members upon translation, which was expected to be  completed by early February 2012 at the latest.</p>
              <p class="paranormaltext"><a name="bkmk416r" id="bkmk416r"></a>On 31 January 2012, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">The measures at issue in this  dispute were the provisional and definitive duties imposed by the Dominican  Republic on imports of polypropylene bags and tubular fabric, as well as the  underlying investigation that led to the adoption of the duties and certain  alleged procedural omissions.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">On the issue of the  applicability of GATT Article&nbsp;XIX and the Safeguards Agreement, the Panel  concluded that the provisional and definitive duties are safeguards, since they  have suspended the Dominican Republic's obligations under GATT Articles I:1  (the most-favoured nation obligation, because certain origins -Colombia,  Indonesia, Mexico and Panama- were excluded from its application) and II:1(b)  (since they have imposed a tariff surcharge, different from an ordinary customs  duty, which was not set forth in the Dominican Republic's GATT Schedule).&nbsp; After concluding that GATT Article&nbsp;XIX  and the Safeguards Agreement were applicable to this dispute, the panel  addressed the substantive claims raised by the complainants.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">The panel found that the  Dominican Republic acted inconsistently with its obligations under  Article&nbsp;XIX:1(a) of the GATT 1994 and Articles 3.1, 4.2(c) and 11.1(a) of  the Safeguards Agreement because the report published by the competent  authorities failed to provide an explanation of the existence of unforeseen  developments and of the effect of the obligations of the GATT 1994.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">The panel found that the  Dominican Republic acted inconsistently with its obligations under Articles&nbsp;2.1  and 4.1(c) of the Safeguards Agreement and Article&nbsp;XIX:1(a) of the GATT  1994, by excluding certain products from the definition of the domestic  directly competitive product, and certain producers of the like or directly  competitive products, for the purpose of defining the domestic industry.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">The panel rejected the  complainants' claim that the Dominican Republic acted inconsistently with its  obligations under Articles 2.1, 3.1, 4.2(a) and 4.2(c) of the Safeguards  Agreement and Article&nbsp;XIX:1(a) of the GATT 1994 in its determination on  the increase in imports in absolute terms and exercised judicial economy with  respect to additional claims of violation with respect to the determination on  the increase in imports in relative terms.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">The panel found that the  Dominican Republic acted inconsistently with its obligations under Articles  2.1, 3.1, 4.1(a), 4.2(a) and 4.2(c) of the Safeguards Agreement and  Article&nbsp;XIX:1(a) of the GATT 1994 by failing to provide reasoned and  adequate explanations with respect to the existence of serious injury.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">The panel rejected the  complainants' claim that the Dominican Republic acted inconsistently with its  obligations under Articles 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.2, 6 and 9.1 of the Safeguards  Agreement by failing to conduct a new analysis to determine the existence of  increase in imports, serious injury and causation (excluding imports from  Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico and Panama).</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">The panel found that the  Dominican Republic acted inconsistently with its obligations under  Article&nbsp;9.1 of the Safeguards Agreement by failing to take all reasonable  steps to exclude Thailand, as a developing country, from the application of the  provisional and definitive safeguard measures.</p>
            <p align="left" class="paranormaltext">The panel rejected the  complainants' claim that the Dominican Republic acted inconsistently with its  obligations under Articles XIX:2 of the GATT 1994 and Article&nbsp;12.1(c) of  the Safeguards Agreement by failing to properly notify the definitive safeguard  measure.&nbsp; The panel also rejected the  complainants' claim that the Dominican Republic acted inconsistently with its  obligations under Articles XIX:2 of the GATT 1994 and Articles 8.1 and 12.3 of  the Safeguards Agreement by failing to provide the complainants with an  adequate opportunity to carry out prior consultations and to obtain an adequate  means of trade compensation.</p></div>

</div>
    <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 22 February 2012, the DSB adopted the panel report.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
    <p class="paranormaltext">At the DSB meeting on  23 March 2012, the Dominican Republic informed the DSB that it intends to  immediately implement the DSB recommendations and rulings in a manner that  respects its WTO obligations.&nbsp; On 13 April  2012, the parties noted for the record that the Dominican Republic had made a  statement at the DSB meeting on 23 March 2012 that it would proceed with the  implementation of the DSB recommendations immediately, and in any case before  30 April 2012.&nbsp; On 7  May 2012, the Dominican Republic informed the DSB that it has been complying  with the DSB recommendations since 21 April 2012 by lifting the safeguard measure  that was the subject of this dispute, and by establishing the MFN tariff at the  level that was in place before the application of the above-mentioned  safeguard.</p>
