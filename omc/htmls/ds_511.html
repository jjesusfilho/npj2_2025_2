        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the United States </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 13 September 2016, the United States requested  consultations with China regarding certain measures through which China appears  to provide domestic support in favour of agricultural producers, in particular,  to those producing wheat, India rice, Japonica rice and corn.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The United States claimed that the measures appear to  be inconsistent with:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>Articles 3.2, 6.3 and 7.2(b) of the Agreement on  Agriculture.</li>
        </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 29 September 2016, the European Union  requested to join the consultations. On 30&nbsp;September&nbsp;2016, Australia,  Canada and Thailand requested to join the consultations. On  5&nbsp;October&nbsp;2016, the Philippines requested to join the consultations.  Subsequently, China informed the DSB that it had accepted the requests of  Australia, Canada, the European Union and Thailand to join the consultations.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 5 December 2016, the United States requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 16 December 2016, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 25 January 2017, the DSB established a panel. Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, the European Union, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and Viet Nam reserved their third-party rights.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Following agreement of the parties, the panel was  composed on 24 June 2017.</p>
      <p align="left">On 22  February 2018, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that the panel expected  to issue its final report to the parties no earlier than the third-quarter of  2018, in accordance with the timetable adopted after consultation with the  parties. The Chair also informed the DSB that the report  would be available to the public once it was circulated to the Members in all  three official languages, and that the date of circulation depended on  completion of translation. On 27 July 2018, the  Chair of the panel informed the DSB that the panel expected to issue its final  report to the parties no later than December 2018, due to the circumstances of  this dispute and in accordance with the timetable adopted in consultations with  the parties. The Chair also indicated that the report  would be available to the public once it was circulated to the Members in all  three official languages, and that the date of circulation would depend on  completion of translation.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext" id="bkmk511r"><a  name="bkmk511r"></a>On 28 February 2019, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
    	    <p align="left">This  dispute concerns China's provision of domestic support, in the form of market  price support (MPS), for producers of each of wheat, Indica rice, Japonica rice  and corn in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. </p>
            <p align="left">The  central element of this dispute was the calculation of the value of China's  market price support (MPS) provided to producers of wheat, rice and corn. Under  the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), MPS is calculated using a mathematical  formula composed of three variables: the applied administered price (AAP), the  fixed external reference price (FERP) and the quantity of production eligible  to receive the AAP (QEP). For the purposes of the present case, the resulting  value of MPS is compared against China's 8.5% <em>de minimis</em> commitment.&nbsp; To  allow for this comparison, the MPS is expressed as a percentage of the total  value of production of the commodity at issue. In the present dispute, if such  percentage is greater than China's 8.5% <em>de  minimis</em> commitment, then China would not be in compliance with its  obligations under Articles 6.3 and 3.2 of the AoA. </p>
            <p align="left">As a threshold matter, the Panel addressed a  terms-of-reference issue brought by China with respect to the measure relating  to corn. The Panel found that, following the 2015 corn  harvest, China had removed an essential element of the  challenged corn measure: the AAP. As a result, the Panel found that the MPS measure  relating to corn had expired prior to US initiation of the dispute. In the  circumstances of the case, the Panel ultimately declined to rule on the corn measure. </p>
            <p align="left">The  Panel then turned to examine the United States' claims under Articles 6.3 and  3.2 of the AoA regarding wheat and rice. For these purposes, it made findings  on how each of the previously mentioned variables were to be defined. </p>
            <p align="left">First,  the Panel found that, in China's case, the FERP should be based on years  1996-1998, drawn from Part IV of China's Schedule, rather than the years  1986-1988, set out in paragraph&nbsp;9 of Annex 3 of the AoA. The Panel reached  this conclusion including by assessing the context provided by the MPS  commitments of the 36 Members that have acceded to the WTO since 1995, which  generally used a base period other than 1986-1988.&nbsp; The Panel reasoned that the use of years  1996-1998 also maintained consistency between the manner in which China's  support for agricultural producers was calculated at the time of China's  accession to the WTO and during the Panel proceedings, allowing an  apples-to-apples comparison. </p>
            <p align="left">The  AAP was not in dispute between the parties, as both agreed that it was the  price set out in the relevant legal instruments for each product for each year.</p>
            <p align="left">Regarding  the QEP, the Panel found that in the absence of any explicit or implicit limits  in China's challenged measures, the QEP for wheat and rice is the entire volume  of production in the relevant specified provinces. Other than the exclusion of grain  of insufficient quality, the Panel found no such limitations in the content of  the measures, nor in Part IV of China's Schedule.</p>
            <p align="left">Having  determined all components necessary to compute China's market price support for  wheat, Indica rice and Japonica rice, the Panel performed the calculation and  found that in each of the years 2012-2015, China exceeded its 8.5% <em>de minimis </em>level of support for each of  these products. The Panel then found that because China's level of support  exceeded the <em>de minimis l</em>evel, it was  also in excess of China's commitment level of &ldquo;nil&rdquo; specified  in Section I of Part IV of China's Schedule CLII.  On that basis, the Panel concluded that China acted inconsistently with its  obligations under Articles 3.2 and 6.3 of the AoA.<strong></strong></p>

          </div>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 26 April 2019, the DSB adopted the panel  report.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reasonable  period of time</h3>
<p align="left">On 16 May 2019, China informed  the DSB that it intended to implement the recommendations and rulings of the  DSB in a manner consistent with its WTO obligations and that it would need a  reasonable period of time to do so.</p>
<p align="left">On 10 June 2019, the United States and China  informed the DSB that they had agreed that the reasonable period of time for  China to implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings would be 11 months and  5 days. Accordingly, the reasonable period of time was set to expire on 31&nbsp;March&nbsp;2020. On  1 April 2020, the United States and China informed the DSB that they had agreed  to extend the reasonable period of time so as to expire on 30 June 2020.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
<p>On 18 June 2020, China informed the DSB of its compliance  in this dispute. In this respect, China explained that in October 2019 and  February 2020 its authorities issued a <em>Notice on Improving the Wheat Minimum  Procurement Price Policy</em> and a <em>Notice on Improving the Rice Minimum  Procurement Price Policy</em>, respectively. China submitted that the Minimum  Procurement Price (&ldquo;MPP&rdquo;) policies maintained under these notices are  consistent with the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in DS511 and the WTO  covered agreements. China submitted that through these measures it fully  implemented the DSB's recommendations in this dispute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Proceedings under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
<p>On 16 July 2020, the United States requested the  authorization of the DSB to suspend concessions or other obligations pursuant  to Article 22.2 of the DSU on the grounds that China had failed to failed to  bring its measures into compliance with its WTO obligations within the  reasonable period of time. On 27 July 2020, China objected to the United States'  proposed level of suspension of concessions pursuant to Article 22.6 of the  DSU. At  the DSB meeting on 29 July 2020,  the Chair of the DSB took note that the matter raised by China  had been referred to arbitration pursuant to Article 22.6 of the DSU. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Compliance proceedings</h3>
<p>On 5 August 2020, China requested the establishment of a  compliance panel. At its meeting on 28&nbsp;August 2020,  the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 28 September 2020,  the DSB established a compliance panel. Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European  Union, Guatemala, India, Japan, Korea, Norway, Pakistan, the Russian  Federation, Chinese Taipei, Thailand,   Turkey and the United Kingdom  reserved their third-party rights.</p>
