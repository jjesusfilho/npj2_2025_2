        <h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the United    States.&nbsp;  (See also <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds395_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS395</a> and <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds398_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS398</a>) </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> On 23 June   2009, the United States  requested consultations with China  with respect to China's  restraints on the export from China  of various forms of raw materials.&nbsp; The United    States cites 32 measures through which China  allegedly imposes restraints on the exports in question and note that there  appear to be additional unpublished restrictive measures.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> The United States  considers that China,  through these measures as well as any amendments, replacements, related  measures, and implementing measures, is in violation of:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>Articles VIII, X, and XI of the GATT  1994; and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
          <li>Paragraphs 5.1, 5.2, 8.2, and 11.3 of Part I of  the Protocol on the Accession of the People's Republic of China  (&ldquo;Accession Protocol&rdquo;), as well as China's obligations under the  provisions of paragraph 1.2 of Part I of the Accession Protocol (which  incorporates commitments in paragraphs 83, 84, 162, and 165 of the Report of  the Working Party on the Accession of China).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The United States  considers that the measures also appear to nullify or impair the benefits  accruing to the United States  directly or indirectly under the cited agreements.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 2 July 2009,  the European Communities requested to join the consultations.&nbsp; On 6   July 2009, Canada,  Mexico and Turkey  requested to join the consultations.&nbsp;  Subsequently, China  informed the DSB that it had accepted the requests of Canada,  the European Communities, Mexico  and Turkey to  join the consultations.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 4 November   2009, the United States  requested the establishment of a panel.&nbsp;  At its meeting on 19&nbsp;November   2009, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting  on 21 December 2009, the DSB  established a single panel, pursuant to Article 9.1 of the DSU, to examine this  dispute and DS395 and DS398.&nbsp; Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, the European  Union, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Norway, Chinese  Taipei and Turkey reserved  their third-party rights. Subsequently, Saudi Arabia reserved its third-party rights.&nbsp; On 19&nbsp;March 2010, the United States, the European Union and Mexico requested the Director-General to determine the  composition of the panel.&nbsp; On 29&nbsp;March   2010, the  Director-General composed the panel. On 19 October  2010, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that the panel would not be  able to issue its report within six months.&nbsp;  The timetable agreed after consultations with the parties envisages the  proceedings will be finalized by April 2011.&nbsp;  The panel expects to conclude its work within that time-frame.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><a name="bkmk394r" id="bkmk394r"></a>On 5 July 2011, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

      </div>
      <div aria-labelledby="headingOne" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseA" role="tabpanel">
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p class="paranormaltext">This dispute  concerns four types of export restraint that China imposes on the export of a  number of raw materials.&nbsp; The raw  materials subject to the export restraints are various forms of bauxite, coke,  fluorspar, magnesium, manganese, silicon carbide, silicon metal, yellow  phosphorus and zinc.&nbsp; China is a leading  producer of each of the raw materials which are used to produce everyday items  as well as technology products.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">
              The  complainants argued that the use of export restraints creates scarcity and  causes higher prices of the raw materials in global markets. They also provide  Chinese domestic industry with a significant advantage by way of a sufficient  supply, and lower and more stable prices for the raw materials.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> Upon its accession  to the WTO, China undertook to eliminate all export duties (taxes) except for a  number of products listed in an  Annex to its Protocol of Accession.&nbsp; In this  Protocol, China also committed not to apply export quotas (restrictions on the  amount that can be exported). </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> In one of its key findings, the Panel found that China's export duties were inconsistent with  the commitments that China had agreed to in its Protocol of Accession. The Panel  also found that export quotas imposed by China on some of the raw  materials were inconsistent with WTO rules.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The Panel found that the wording of China's Protocol of  Accession did not allow China to use the general exceptions in Article XX of  the GATT 1994 to justify its WTO-inconsistent export duties. The Panel also  considered that even if China were able to rely on certain exceptions available  in the WTO rules to justify its export duties, it had not complied with the  requirements of those exceptions.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> In particular, China had argued in its defence that some  of its export duties and quotas were justified because they related to the  conservation of exhaustible natural resources for some of the raw  materials.&nbsp; But China was not able to  demonstrate that it imposed these restrictions in conjunction with restrictions  on domestic production or consumption of the raw materials so as to conserve  the raw materials.&nbsp; The Panel  acknowledged, however, that China appears to be heading in the right direction  in adopting a framework to justify its quotas under WTO rules, but that the  framework is not yet WTO-consistent as it still has to be put into effect for  domestic producers.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> As for other of the raw materials, China had claimed  that its export quotas and duties were necessary for the protection of the  health of its citizens.&nbsp; China was unable  to demonstrate that its export duties and quotas would lead to a reduction of  pollution in the short- or long-term and therefore contribute towards improving  the health of its people.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> China also committed to eliminate all restrictions on  the &ldquo;right to trade&rdquo; &mdash; rights given to enterprises by China in  parallel to market access and non-discrimination provisions guaranteed under  the WTO.&nbsp; The complainants were  successful in most of their trading rights claims.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> Regarding the administration and allocation of its  export quotas, China successfully  defended its practices in claims brought by the United States and Mexico  whereas the European&nbsp;Union succeeded in its separate claim that it brought  against China.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The Panel also found that certain aspects of China's export  licensing regime, applicable to several of the products at issue, restrict the  export of the raw materials and so are inconsistent with WTO rules.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 31 August 2011, China notified  the DSB of its decision to appeal certain issues of law and legal interpretations of  the panel report.&nbsp; On 6 September 2011,  the United States notified the DSB of its decision to appeal certain  issues of law and legal interpretations of the panel report. On 28&nbsp;October 2011, the Chair of the Appellate  Body notified the DSB that due to the significant size of this appeal,  including the number and complexity of the issues raised by both China  and each of the three other appellants, the Appellate Body would not be able to  circulate its report within 90&nbsp;days.&nbsp;  The Appellate Body report will be circulated to  Members no later than 31 January 2012.</p>

      <div aria-labelledby="headingTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseB" role="tabpanel">
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p class="paranormaltext">This dispute concerns certain measures imposed by China affecting  the exportation of certain forms of bauxite, coke, fluorspar, magnesium,  manganese, silicon carbide, silicon metal, yellow phosphorous, and zinc.&nbsp; Before the Panel, the United States, Mexico,  and the European Union (the &ldquo;complainants&rdquo;) challenged four types of export  restraints imposed on the different raw materials at issue: &nbsp;(i) export  duties; &nbsp;(ii) export quotas; &nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;minimum export price  requirements;&nbsp; and (iv) export licensing  requirements.&nbsp; Collectively, the  complainants identified 40 specific Chinese measures in connection with their  claims.&nbsp; The complainants alleged that  these export restraints, as well as aspects of the administration and  allocation of certain measures, were inconsistent with China's commitments  under China's Accession Protocol and China's Accession Working Party Report,  and Articles VIII:1(a), X:1, X:3(a), and XI:1 of the GATT 1994.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> On appeal, the Appellate Body <strong>found</strong> that the Panel erred under  Article 6.2 of the DSU in making findings regarding claims allegedly identified  in Section III of the complainants' panel requests.&nbsp; The Appellate Body reasoned that, in the  light of the failure by the complainants to provide sufficiently clear linkages  between the broad range of obligations contained in provisions of the covered  agreements allegedly violated, and the 37 challenged measures, Section III of  the complainants' panel requests did not satisfy the requirement in Article 6.2  of the DSU to &ldquo;provide a brief summary of the legal basis of the complaint  sufficient to present the problem clearly&rdquo;.&nbsp; Consequently, the Appellate Body <strong>declared</strong> moot and of no legal effect the Panel's findings regarding claims allegedly  identified in Section III of the complainants' panel requests.(<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="paracolourtext" id="_ftnref1">1</a>)</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body <strong>upheld</strong> the Panel's recommendation that China  bring its export duty and export quota measures into conformity with its WTO  obligations such that the &ldquo;series of measures&rdquo; do not operate to  bring about a WTO-inconsistent result.&nbsp;  For the Appellate Body, the complainants' challenge in this case was not  to specific annual duty or quota measures in isolation or, as China claimed, to  on-going conduct consisting of a &ldquo;chain of annually reviewed  measures&rdquo;.&nbsp; Rather, the  Appellate&nbsp;Body considered that the Panel correctly described the object of  the complainants' challenge as the legal situation prevailing in 2009, that is,  the &ldquo;series of measures&rdquo; pursuant to which China imposed export  quotas and duties on the raw materials at issue at the time the Panel was  established.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The United States and Mexico filed <strong>conditional other appeals</strong> in  the event that the Appellate&nbsp;Body were to reverse the Panel's  recommendation and find that no recommendation should have been made on the  &ldquo;series of measures&rdquo; as they existed on the date of the Panel's  establishment.&nbsp; In addition, the European  Union filed a <strong>conditional other appeal</strong> in case the Appellate Body were  to accept China's grounds for appeal and also reject the other appeals  submitted by the United States and Mexico.&nbsp;  As the condition on which the United States and Mexico premised their  request was not met, the Appellate Body <strong>found</strong> that there was no need to  address the United States' and Mexico's conditional appeal.&nbsp; For the same reason, the Appellate Body did  not address the European Union's conditional other appeal.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body <strong>upheld</strong> the Panel's finding that there is no  basis in China's Accession Protocol to allow the application of Article&nbsp;XX  of the GATT&nbsp;1994 to China's obligations under Paragraph&nbsp;11.3 of the  Accession Protocol.&nbsp; In upholding the  Panel's finding, the Appellate&nbsp;Body examined the text of Paragraph 11.3  and found that the provision does not suggest that China may have recourse to  Article&nbsp;XX to justify a breach of its obligation to eliminate export  duties.&nbsp; The Appellate&nbsp;Body  concluded that a proper interpretation of Paragraph 11.3 of China's Accession  Protocol does not make available to China the exceptions under Article&nbsp;XX  of the GATT 1994 to justify export duties that are found to be inconsistent  with China's obligations under Paragraph 11.3.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body further <strong>upheld</strong> the Panel's conclusion that  China did not demonstrate that its export quota on refractory-grade bauxite was  &ldquo;temporarily applied&rdquo; to either prevent or relieve a &ldquo;critical  shortage&rdquo;, within the meaning of Article&nbsp;XI:2(a) of the GATT 1994.&nbsp; The Appellate Body found that an export  prohibition or restriction applied &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; in the sense of  Article XI:2(a) is a measure applied in the interim, to provide relief in  extraordinary conditions in order to bridge a passing need.&nbsp; The Appellate Body agreed with the Panel that  such a restriction must be of a limited duration and not indefinite.&nbsp; Moreover, the Appellate Body found that the  term &ldquo;critical shortages&rdquo; refers to those deficiencies in quantity  that are crucial and of decisive importance, or that reach a vitally important  or decisive stage.&nbsp; On the basis of these  findings, the Appellate Body upheld the Panel's conclusion that China did not  demonstrate that its export quota on refractory-grade bauxite was  &ldquo;temporarily applied&rdquo; to either prevent or relieve a &ldquo;critical  shortage&rdquo;.&nbsp; The Appellate&nbsp;Body  further rejected China's claim that the Panel acted inconsistently with its  duty to conduct an objective assessment of the matter as required by Article 11  of the DSU.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body <strong>found</strong> that the Panel erred in interpreting  the phrase &ldquo;made effective in conjunction with&rdquo; in Article XX(g) of  the GATT 1994 to require that the purpose of the challenged measure must be to ensure  the effectiveness of restrictions on domestic production and consumption, and  therefore <strong>reversed</strong> this interpretation by the Panel.&nbsp; Contrary to the Panel's findings, the  Appellate Body saw nothing in the text of Article&nbsp;XX(g) to suggest that,  in addition to being &ldquo;made effective in conjunction with restrictions on  domestic production or consumption&rdquo;, a trade restriction must be aimed at  ensuring the effectiveness of domestic restrictions, as the Panel found.&nbsp; </p>
