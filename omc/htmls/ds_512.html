        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Ukraine </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 14 September 2016, Ukraine requested  consultations with the Russian Federation regarding alleged multiple  restrictions on traffic in transit from Ukraine through the Russian Federation  to third countries.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">Ukraine claimed that the measures appear to be  inconsistent with:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>Articles  V:2, V:3, V:4, V:5, X:1, X:2, X:3(a), XI:1, XVI:4 of the GATT 1994; and <br>
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>Paragraph 2 of Part I of the Russian  Federation's Accession Protocol (to the extent that  it incorporates paragraphs 1161, 1426 (first sentence), 1427 (first and third  sentences) and 1428 of the Report of the Working Party on the Accession of the  Russian Federation). </li>

        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
                <p class="paranormaltext">On 9 February 2017, Ukraine requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 20 February 2017, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
        
        <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 21 March 2017, the DSB established a panel. Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Moldova, Norway, Paraguay, Saudi  Arabia, Singapore, Turkey and the United States reserved their third-party rights. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 22  May 2017, Ukraine requested the Director-General to compose the panel. On 6 June  2017, the Director-General composed the panel.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 17 November 2017, the Chair of the  panel informed the DSB that the panel expected to issue its final report to the  parties by the end of 2018, in accordance with the timetable adopted after  consultation with the parties. The Chair also informed  the DSB that the report would be available to the public once it was circulated  to the Members in all three official languages, and that the date of  circulation depends on completion of translation.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On&nbsp;28 September&nbsp;2018, the Chair  of the panel informed the DSB that, in the light of the complexity of the legal  and factual issues in this dispute, the panel expected to issue its final  report to the parties in the first quarter of 2019. The  Chair reminded the DSB that the report would be available to the public once it  was circulated to the Members in all three official languages, and that the  date of circulation depends on completion of translation.</p>

    	    <p>The dispute concerned Ukraine's challenges to Russian bans  and restrictions on traffic in transit by road and rail, from Ukraine, across  Russia and destined for Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, as well as to the  alleged <em>de facto</em> extension of these  bans and restrictions to Ukrainian traffic in transit destined for Mongolia,  Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan (para 7.1).</p>
            <p>Ukraine claimed that these transit measures are inconsistent  with Russia's obligations under Article V (freedom of transit), Article X (publication  and administration of trade regulations) and with related commitments in Russia's  Accession Protocol (para. 7.2). Russia asserted that the measures were among  those that it considered necessary for the protection of its essential security  interests, which it took in response to the emergency in international  relations that occurred in 2014, and which presented threats to Russia's  essential security interests. Russia therefore invoked the provisions of Article  XXI(b)(iii) of the GATT 1994, arguing that, as a result, the Panel lacked jurisdiction  to further address the matter (paras. 7.3-7.4). </p>
            <p>The Panel found&nbsp;that WTO panels have jurisdiction to  review aspects of a Member's invocation of Article XXI(b)(iii), that Russia had  met the requirements for invoking Article XXI(b)(iii) in relation to the  measures at issue, and therefore, that the transit bans and restrictions were  covered by Article XXI(b)(iii) of the GATT 1994.</p>
            <p>Specifically, the Panel found that, while the chapeau of  Article XXI(b) allows a Member to take action &ldquo;which it considers  necessary&rdquo; for the protection of its essential security interests, this  discretion is limited to circumstances that objectively fall within the scope  of the three subparagraphs of Article XXI(b) (see paras. 7.101 and 7.53-7.100).  Consequently, the Panel rejected Russia's jurisdictional argument that Article  XXI(b)(iii) was totally &ldquo;self-judging&rdquo; (paras. 7.102-7.104). </p>
            <p>Turning to subparagraph (iii) of Article XXI(b), and based  on the particular circumstances affecting relations between Russia and Ukraine,  the Panel determined from the evidence before it that the situation between  Ukraine and Russia since 2014 was an &ldquo;emergency in international  relations&rdquo; (paras. 7.76 and 7.114-7.123). The Panel also determined that the  challenged transit bans and restrictions were taken in 2014 and 2016, and therefore  were &ldquo;taken in time of&rdquo; this 2014 emergency (paras. 7.70 and 7.124-7.125).  Accordingly, the Panel found that Russia's actions were objectively &ldquo;taken  in time of&rdquo; an &ldquo;emergency in international relations&rdquo; under  Article XXI(b)(iii) (see para. 7.126).</p>
            <p>As  for the discretion accorded to a Member under the chapeau of Article XXI(b),  the Panel found that &ldquo;essential security interests&rdquo; could be  generally understood as referring to those interests relating to the  quintessential functions of the state. The Panel observed that the specific  interests at issue will depend on the particular situation and perceptions of  the state in question and can be expected to vary with changing circumstances.  For these reasons, the Panel held that it is left in general to every Member to  define what it considers to be its essential security interests (see paras. 7.130-7.131).  Moreover, the Panel found that the specific language &ldquo;which it  considers&rdquo; meant that it is for a Member itself to decide on the  &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; of its actions for the protection of its essential  security interests (see paras. 7.146-7.147).</p>
            <p>That  said, the Panel considered that a Member's general obligations to interpret and  apply Article XXI(b)(iii) in good faith meant that WTO panels may review, (i) whether  there was any evidence to suggest that the Member's designation of its  essential security interests was not made in good faith, and (ii) whether the  challenged measures were &ldquo;not implausible&rdquo; as measures to protect  those essential security interests (see paras. 7.132-7.135 and 7.138-7.139). Accordingly,  the Panel considered that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The 2014 emergency said to threaten Russia's  essential security interests was very close to the &ldquo;hard core&rdquo; of war  or armed conflict. In these circumstances, the Panel was satisfied of the  veracity of Russia's designation of its essential security interests (paras.  7.136-7.137).</li>
              <li>The challenged transit bans and restrictions  were not so remote from or unrelated to the 2014 emergency that it was  implausible that Russia implemented these measures for the protection of its  essential security interests arising out of the 2014 emergency (paras.  7.140-7.145).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The  Panel also explained that Article XXI(b)(iii) acknowledges that a war or other  emergency in international relations &ldquo;involves a fundamental change of  circumstances which radically alters the factual matrix in which the  WTO-consistency of the measures at issue is to be evaluated.&rdquo; Unlike  evaluations of whether measures are covered by the exceptions in Article XX, an  evaluation of measures under Article XXI(b)(iii) does not necessitate a prior  determination that the measures would be WTO-inconsistent had they been taken  in &ldquo;normal times&rdquo; (para. 7.108). The Panel therefore considered that,  once it had found that the measures at issue were within its terms of reference  and that Ukraine had established their existence, the &ldquo;most logical next  step&rdquo; was to determine whether the measures were covered by Article  XXI(b)(iii) of the GATT 1994 (para. 7.109). </p>
            <p>The Panel acknowledged, however, that should its findings on  Russia's invocation of Article XXI(b)(iii) be reversed in the event of an  appeal, it may be necessary for the Appellate Body to complete the analysis  (para. 7.154). In this connection, the Panel concluded that had the measures  been taken in normal times, i.e. had they not been taken in an &ldquo;emergency  in international relations&rdquo; (and met the other conditions of Article  XXI(b)), Ukraine would have made a <em>prima  facie</em> case that the measures at issue were inconsistent with (i) the first or  second sentence of Article V:2 of the GATT 1994, or both, and (ii) related commitments  in paragraph 1161 of Russia's Working Party Report (see paras. 7.166-7.184,  7.189-7.196 and 7.239-7.240). The Panel did not consider it necessary to  address Ukraine's claims of violation of the other provisions of Article V and  Article X of the GATT 1994 or other commitments in Russia's Accession Protocol  (see paras. 7.197-7.201).</p>
