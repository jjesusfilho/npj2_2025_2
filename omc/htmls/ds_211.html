		<h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Turkey. </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 6 November 2000, Turkey
      requested consultations with Egypt concerning an anti-dumping
      investigation by the Egyptian Ministry of Trade and Supply with respect to
      imports of rebar from Turkey. The investigation was completed and the
      final report released on 21 October 1999. As a result of the
      investigation, anti-dumping duties were imposed, ranging from 22.63-61.00
      per cent ad valorem.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Turkey considered that:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>Egypt made determinations of injury and dumping in that
      investigation without a proper establishment of the facts and based on an
      evaluation of the facts that was neither unbiased nor objective;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>during the investigation of material injury or threat
      thereof and the causal link, Egypt acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1,
      3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 6.1 and 6.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement; and<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>during the investigation of sales at less than normal
      value, Egypt violated Article X:3 of the GATT 1994, as well as Articles
      2.2, 2.4, 6.1, 6.2, 6.6, 6.7 and 6.8, and Annex II, Paragraphs 1, 3, 5, 6
      and 7 and Annex I, Paragraph 7 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 3 May 2001, Turkey requested the establishment of a
      panel. At its meeting on 16 May 2001, the DSB deferred the establishment
      of a panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Further to a second request to establish a panel by Turkey,
        the DSB established a panel at its meeting of 20 June 2001. Chile, the EC,
        Japan and the US reserved their third party rights. On 18 July 2001, the
        Panel was composed.</p>

      <p class="paranormaltext">On 8 August 2002, the Panel Report was circulated to
      WTO Members. The Panel concluded that Egypt did not act inconsistently
      with its obligations under:</p>
      <ol class="paranormaltext" type="a">
        <li> Article 3.4 of the AD Agreement, as Turkey has not
      established that the Egyptian Investigating Authority was required to
      examine and evaluate the particular factors identified by Turkey as “relevant factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the
      domestic industry”;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article 3.2 of the AD Agreement, as Turkey has not
      established that there was a legal obligation on the Egyptian
      Investigating Authority to perform the price undercutting analysis in the
      way asserted by Turkey;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article 3.1 of the AD Agreement, as Turkey has not
      established that the Egyptian Investigating Authority’s price undercutting
      finding was not based on positive evidence;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Articles 6.1 and 6.2 of the AD Agreement in respect
      of the alleged change in scope of the injury investigation from threat of
      material injury to present material injury and notice thereof to the
      Turkish exporters;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Articles 3.1 and 3.5 of the AD Agreement, as Turkey
      has not established that the Egyptian Investigating Authority violated the
      positive evidence requirement of Article 3.1 by virtue of the
      Investigating Authority not developing certain specific kinds of evidence,
      nor has Turkey established that, as a consequence, Egypt violated the
      requirement of Article 3.5 to demonstrate a causal relationship between
      the dumped imports and the injury to the domestic industry;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article 3.5 of the AD Agreement, as Turkey has not
      established that the Egyptian Investigating Authority’s evaluation of the
      possible causation of injury by factors other than the dumped imports was
      inconsistent with Article 3.5;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article 3.1 and 3.5 of the AD Agreement, as Turkey
      has not established that the Egyptian Investigating Authority was
      obligated by Articles 3.1 and 3.5 to perform an analysis and make a
      finding of the type asserted by Turkey in respect of whether the imports
      caused injury “through the effects of dumping”;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article 6.8 of the AD Agreement and paragraph 5 of
      Annex II thereto, with regard to three of the Turkish exporters, as an
      unbiased and objective investigating authority could have found that these
      three exporters failed to provide necessary information and that resort to
      facts available was therefore justified in calculating the cost of
      production in respect of these three exporters;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article 6.1.1 of the AD Agreement, as the request
      for information at issue was not a “questionnaire” in the sense
      of this provision, and the minimum time-period provided for in Article
      6.1.1 was therefore not applicable to this request for information;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article 6.2 of the AD Agreement, or paragraph 6 of
      Annex II thereto, with regard to the 19 August 1999 request for
      information, as Turkey has not established that the time-period allowed by
      the Egyptian Investigating Authority for submission of the requested
      information was unreasonable or, as a consequence, that the Egyptian
      Investigating Authority failed to provide the Turkish exporters with a
      full opportunity for the defence of their interests;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article 6.2 of the AD Agreement, or paragraph 6 of
      Annex II thereto, with regard to the 23 September 1999 request for
      information, as Turkey has not established that the time-period allowed by
      the Egyptian Investigating Authority for the submission of the requested
      information was unreasonable or, as a consequence, that the Egyptian
      Investigating Authority failed to provide the Turkish exporters with a
      full opportunity for the defence of their interests;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Paragraph 3 of Annex II to the AD Agreement, as
      this provision does not apply to the selection of particular information
      as “facts available”;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Paragraph 7 of Annex II to the AD Agreement, as
      Turkey has not established that the Egyptian Investigating Authority
      failed to use “special circumspection” in estimating the
      prevailing inflation rate in Turkey, which was applied to the data
      reported by one respondent, at 5 per cent per month;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article 6.7 of the AD Agreement, paragraph 7 of
      Annex I thereto, and paragraphs 1 and 6 of Annex II thereto, as Turkey has
      not established that these provisions contain the obligations asserted by
      Turkey, i.e., Turkey has not established that it is mandatory for
      investigating authorities to conduct “on-the-spot” verification
      of information submitted, that investigating authorities are precluded
      from requesting additional information during the course of the
      investigation, that the rights of the Turkish exporters were seriously
      prejudiced, or that the actions of the Egyptian Investigating Authority
      impaired their “opportunity to provide further explanations”;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article 2.4 of the AD Agreement, as Turkey has not
      established that the burden of proof requirement of that provision is
      applicable to the request for certain cost information by the Egyptian
      Investigating Authority in its letter of 19 August 1999, nor, even if that
      requirement were applicable, that the request imposed an unreasonable
      burden of proof on the Turkish respondents;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article 6.2 of the AD Agreement and paragraph 6 of
      Annex II thereto, as Turkey has not established that the Egyptian
      Investigating Authority denied requests of Turkish exporters for meetings;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article 2.4 of the AD Agreement, as Turkey has not
      made a <i>prima facie</i> case that the Egyptian Investigating Authority
      violated this provision in failing to make an adjustment to normal value
      for differences in terms of sale;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Articles 2.2.1.1 and 2.2.2 of the AD Agreement, as
      Turkey has not made a <i>prima facie</i> case that the Egyptian
      Investigating Authority violated these provisions in deciding not to make
      an interest income offset in calculating cost of production and
      constructed normal value; and<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article X:3 of GATT 1994 as Turkey has not
      established that Egypt administered its relevant laws, regulations,
      decisions or rulings in a non-uniform, non-impartial or unreasonable
      manner in deciding not to accept an offer of certain respondents to travel
      to Cairo for a meeting with the Investigating Authority.</li>
      </ol>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The Panel concluded that Egypt acted inconsistently
      with its obligations under:</p>
        <ol class="paranormaltext" type="a" start="20">
        <li> Article 3.4 of the AD Agreement, in that while it
      gathered data on all of the factors listed in Article 3.4, the Egyptian
      Investigating Authority failed to evaluate all of the factors listed in
      Article 3.4 as it did not evaluate productivity, actual and potential
      negative effects on cash flow, employment, wages, and ability to raise
      capital or investments; and<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li> Article 6.8 of the AD Agreement, and paragraph 6 of
      Annex II thereto, with regard to two of the Turkish exporters, as the
      Egyptian Investigating Authority, having received the information that it
      had identified to these two respondents as being necessary, nevertheless
      found that they had failed to provide the necessary information, and
      further, did not inform these two exporters of this finding and did not
      give them the required opportunity to provide further explanations before
      resorting to facts available.</li>
      </ol>
        <p class="paranormaltext">With respect to those of Turkey’s claims not addressed
      above, the Panel concluded that:</p>
        <ol class="paranormaltext" type="a" start="22">
        <li>the claim was not within its terms of reference
      (claim under AD Article 17.6(i), claim under Article X:3 of GATT 1994 in
      respect of selection of particular facts available), or was abandoned by
      Turkey (claim under Article X:3 in respect of resort to facts available);
      or<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>in the light of considerations of judicial economy,
      it was neither necessary nor appropriate to make findings.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="paranormaltext">The Panel recommended Egypt to bring its definitive
      anti-dumping measures on imports of steel rebar from Turkey into
      conformity with the relevant provisions of the AD Agreement.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 1 October 2002, the DSB adopted the Panel Report.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
	  <h3>Implementation  of adopted reports</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext">On 14 November 2002, Egypt and Turkey informed
        the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body, that they had mutually
        agreed that the reasonable period of time to implement the
        recommendations and rulings of DSB should not be more than nine months,
        that is from 1 November 2002 until 31 July 2003.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">At the DSB  meeting on 29 August 2003, Egypt informed the DSB that Egypt's investigating authorities had submitted on 30 July 2003 the final report to the Turkish authorities.&nbsp; The final report reflected faithfully, and in  a proper manner, the implementation of all the  recommendations of the panel.&nbsp; Therefore, Egypt declared that it was in full compliance with the  DSB recommendations.</p>
