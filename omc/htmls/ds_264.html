		<h3>Consultations</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Canada. </strong></p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 13   September 2002, Canada  requested consultations under Article 4.8 of the DSU (urgency procedure) with  the United States concerning the final affirmative determination of sales at  less than fair value (dumping) with respect to certain softwood lumber products  from Canada  (Inv. No.&nbsp;A-122-838) announced by the US Department of Commerce (USDOC) on  21 March 2002  pursuant to Section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended on 22 May 2002 (Final  Determination). The measures at issue include the initiation of the  investigation, the conduct of the investigation and the Final Determination.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> Canada considered these measures and, in particular,  the determinations made and methodologies adopted therein by the DOC under  authority of the United States Tariff Act of 1930, to violate Articles  1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.8, 6.1, 6.2, 6.4, 6.9 and 9.3 of  the Anti-Dumping Agreement and  Articles VI and X:3(a) of the GATT 1994.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 6   December 2002, Canada  requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting of 19&nbsp;December  2002, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> Further to a second request by Canada, a panel  was established by the DSB at its meeting on 8&nbsp;January 2003. The European Communities  and India  reserved their third-party rights. On 15&nbsp;January 2003, Japan reserved  its third-party rights. On 25 February 2003, the panel was composed.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 25 August 2003, the Chairman of the panel informed  the DSB that due to the complexity of the matter, the panel would not be able  to complete its work in six months. The panel expected to issue its final  report to the parties in December 2003. On 2 December 2003, the Chairman of the  panel informed the DSB that the panel expected to issue its final report to the  parties in February 2004.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 13 April 2004, the panel report was circulated to  Members. The panel found that, in its final dumping determination, the USDOC  failed to comply with the requirements of Articles 2.4.2 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement because the DOC did not take into account all export transactions by  applying the &ldquo;zeroing&rdquo; methodology when calculating the margin of dumping. (One  member of the panel issued a dissenting opinion regarding the finding on  &ldquo;zeroing&rdquo;.) The panel found that all other claims submitted by Canada failed.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 13 May 2004, the United States notified its decision  to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the panel report  and certain legal interpretations developed by the panel. On 8 July 2004, the  Chairman of the Appellate Body informed the DSB that it would not be possible  for the Appellate Body to complete its work within 60-day period due to the  time required for completion and translation of the report. The Appellate Body  expected to complete its work no later than 11 August 2004.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 11 August 2004, the Appellate Body report was  circulated to Members. The Appellate Body:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext"><strong>upheld</strong> the panel&rsquo;s finding that the  United States had acted inconsistently with the Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement by calculating margins of dumping on the  basis of a methodology incorporating the practice of &ldquo;zeroing&rdquo;;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext"><strong>reversed</strong> the panel&rsquo;s finding that the  United States did not act inconsistently with the Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement when calculating the amount of financial  expense attributable to the production of softwood lumber for Abitibi, one of  the Canadian companies under investigation. Although the Appellate Body  reversed the panel on this issue, it was not required itself to rule on whether  the United States had acted inconsistently with its WTO obligations in this  regard; and<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext"><strong>upheld</strong> the panel&rsquo;s finding that the  United States did not act inconsistently with certain provisions of the Anti-Dumping Agreement when  calculating the amount for by-product revenue from the &ldquo;sale&rdquo; of wood chips for  Tembec, another Canadian company under investigation. The Appellate Body did  not disturb the panel&rsquo;s finding that the United States had not acted in a  biased, non-objective, or other than even-handed manner. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 31 August 2004, the DSB adopted the Appellate  Body report and the Panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body report.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Compliance proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 19 May 2005, Canada requested the establishment of a  panel under Article 21.5 of the DSU. On 27&nbsp;May 2005, Canada and the United States notified  the DSB of an Understanding regarding procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of  the DSU. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 1 June 2005, the DSB decided to refer the  matter raised by Canada  to the original panel. China, India, Japan and the European Communities  reserved their third party rights. Subsequently, New Zealand and Thailand  reserved their third party rights.&nbsp; On  3&nbsp;June 2005, the formalities in composing the panel were completed.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 3 August 2005, the Chairman of the compliance panel  resigned following his appointment as a Deputy Director-General of the WTO  Secretariat.&nbsp; On 18 August 2005, Canada  requested the Director-General to appoint a replacement Chairperson. On 26  August 2005, the Director-General appointed a new Chairman.&nbsp; On 16  September 2005, the Chairman of the compliance panel informed the DSB that it  would not be possible for the compliance panel to complete its work in 90&nbsp;days  in light of the withdrawal of the Chairman of the compliance panel and  consequent need to appoint a new Chairman, and scheduling conflicts.&nbsp; The compliance panel expected to complete its  work in February 2006. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 3 April 2006, the compliance panel report was circulated  to Members. This proceeding concerned the implementation by the United States  of part of the DSB recommendations and rulings relating to the finding that the  use of &ldquo;zeroing&rdquo; by the USDOC in the underlying investigation was inconsistent  with Article 2.4.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement in the context of a comparison  of &ldquo;a weighted average normal value with a weighted average of all comparable  export transactions&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> In order to implement the DSB's recommendations and  rulings, the USDOC calculated new rates for the exporters subject to the anti-dumping  duty order, based on a comparison of normal value and export prices on a  transaction-to-transaction basis. The USDOC used zeroing in its  transaction-to-transaction methodology. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Canada claimed that the USDOC's continued use of  zeroing under the transaction-to-transaction comparison methodology was  inconsistent with Articles 2.4.2 and 2.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. The  compliance panel concluded that the determination of the USDOC in the Section  129 proceeding investigation was not inconsistent with the asserted provisions  of Articles 2.4 and 2.4.2 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement.&nbsp; The compliance panel therefore considered  that the United&nbsp;States had implemented the DSB's recommendations and  rulings to bring its measure into conformity with its obligations under the  Anti-Dumping Agreement.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 17   May 2006, Canada  notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues  of law and certain legal interpretations covered in the panel report. On 14 July 2006, the Appellate  Body informed the DSB that due to the time required for completion and  translation of the report, the Appellate Body would not be able to circulate  its report within the 60-day period, and that it estimated that the Appellate  Body report would be circulated to WTO Members no later than 15 August 2006. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 15   August 2006, the Appellate Body report was circulated to  Members.&nbsp; The Appellate Body reversed the compliance panel's findings and  found, instead, that the use of zeroing was not permitted under the transaction-to-transaction  methodology set out in Article 2.4.2 of the Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement because &ldquo;the  &lsquo;margins of dumping&rsquo; established under this methodology are the results of the  aggregation of the transaction-specific comparisons of export prices and normal  value&rdquo;, and &ldquo;in aggregating these results, an investigating authority must  consider the results of all of the comparisons and may not disregard the  results of comparisons in which export prices are above normal value&rdquo;. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> In addition, the Appellate Body found that the use of  zeroing under the transaction-to-transaction comparison methodology in the  Section 129 Determination was inconsistent with the &ldquo;fair comparison&rdquo;  requirement in Article 2.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because it distorted  the price of certain export transactions, which were not considered at their  real value, and artificially inflated the magnitude of dumping, resulting in  higher margins of dumping and making a positive determination of dumping more  likely. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body reversed the compliance panel's  conclusion that the United States had implemented the DSB recommendations and  rulings and recommended that the DSB request the United States to bring its  measure into conformity with its obligations under the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 1&nbsp;September 2006, the DSB  adopted the Appellate Body report and the compliance panel report, as reversed  by the Appellate Body report. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Proceedings under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Simultaneous to the request for compliance proceedings  (see above) on 19 May 2005, Canada requested the DSB authorization to suspend  concessions or other obligations with respect to the United States under  Article 22.2 of the DSU in an amount representing the portion of the total anti&#8209;dumping  duties illegally collected and not refunded as a result of the United States'  non&#8209;compliance (i.e. the United States' failure to eliminate the practice of  zeroing), specifying that for 2005, this amount will be approximately CAD 400  million. Canada stated it intended to implement this suspension of tariff  concessions and related obligations under the GATT 1994 by imposing additional  import duties above bound custom duties on products originating in the United  States. On 31 May 2005, the United States objected to the level of suspension  proposed by Canada and requested this matter to be referred to arbitration in  accordance with Article 22.6 of the DSU. At its meeting of 1 June 2005, parallel  to referring the compliance issue to the compliance panel (see above), the DSB  agreed that the matter raised by the United States be referred to arbitration  in accordance with Article 22.6 of the DSU. Pursuant to the Understanding  regarding procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU, the Article 22.6  arbitration proceeding was suspended until the completion of the Article 21.5  proceeding. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> In light of the mutually agreed solution (see below),  the suspended Article 22.6 arbitration proceeding was withdrawn.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3> Mutually agreed solution</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 12   October 2006, the United    States and Canada informed the DSB that they  had reached a mutually agreed solution under Article 3.6 of the DSU in the  disputes <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds236_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">WT/DS236</a>, <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds247_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">WT/DS247</a>, <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds257_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">WT/DS257</a>, WT/DS264, <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds277_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">WT/DS277</a> and <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds311_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">WT/DS311</a>.&nbsp;  This solution was in the form of a comprehensive agreement (Softwood Lumber Agreement)  between the United States  and Canada,  dated 12&nbsp;September 2006. On 23 February 2007, the United States and Canada informed  the DSB that on 12 October   2006 they had concluded a further Agreement, which amended the  original Agreement to facilitate its entry into force.</p>
