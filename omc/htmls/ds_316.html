        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the United States (See also dispute <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds347_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS347</a>). </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 6 October 2004, the United States
        requested consultations with the Governments of Germany, France, the
        United Kingdom, and Spain (the “member States”), and with the
        European Communities (“EC”) concerning measures affecting trade in
large civil aircraft.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">According to the request for consultations
        from the United States, measures by the EC and the member States provide
        subsidies that are inconsistent with their obligations under the SCM
        Agreement and GATT 1994. The measures include: the provision of
        financing for design and development to Airbus companies (“launch
        aid”); the provision of grants and government-provided goods and
        services to develop, expand, and upgrade Airbus manufacturing sites for
        the development and production of the Airbus A380; the provision of
        loans on preferential terms; the assumption and forgiveness of debt
        resulting from launch and other large civil aircraft production and
        development financing; the provision of equity infusions and grants; the
        provision of research and development loans and grants in support of
        large civil aircraft development, directly for the benefit of Airbus,
        and any other measures involving a financial contribution to the Airbus
        companies. The subsidies in question include those relating to the
        entire family of Airbus products (A300 through the A380)</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The United States further notes that certain
        launch aid provided for the A340 and A380 appear to be illegal export
        subsidies in contravention of certain provisions of Article 3 of the SCM
        Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The United States is further concerned that
        the measures appear to be causing adverse effects to US in a manner
        contrary to the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of the SCM Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The United States is also concerned that the
        measures appear to be inconsistent with Article XVI:1 of GATT 1994.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">Finally, the United States is concerned that
        the measures have caused and continue to cause nullification or
        impairment of benefits to the United States under GATT 1994 within the
        meaning of Article XXIII:1.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 31&nbsp;May&nbsp;2005, the United States requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 13&nbsp;June 2005, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 20 July 2005, the DSB established a panel. Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan and Korea reserved their third-party rights. </p>
  <p class="paranormaltext">At its&nbsp;23 September 2005 meeting, the DSB initiated the procedures provided in Annex V of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 7 October&nbsp;2005, the United States&nbsp;requested the Director-General to compose the panel. On 17 October 2005, Deputy Director Alejandro Jara, acting in place of the Director-General who recused himself on this matter, composed the panel. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 13 April 2006, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that the panel would not be able to complete its work within six months due to the substantive and procedural complexities involved in this dispute, including the process of developing information concerning serious prejudice under Annex V of the SCM Agreement, another request for consultations by the United States, the panel's subsequent agreement, at the parties' request, to set aside the original timetable for the dispute until an unspecified date in the future, and another request for the establishment of a panel by the United States.


 The Panel expected to complete its work in 2007. On 14 December 2007, the Chairman of the Panel informed the DSB that due to the substantive and procedural complexities involved in this dispute, it now expected to complete its work in 2008.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 17   October 2008,  the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that due to, inter alia, the substantive and  procedural complexities, and the volume of materials involved in this dispute,  it expected to complete its works in 2009.&nbsp;  On 3&nbsp;December 2009, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that  due to, inter  alia, the substantive and procedural complexities, and the volume of  materials involved in this dispute, it now expected to complete its work before  the end of April 2010.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">Prior to the panel proceedings,  a procedure under Annex V of the SCM Agreementfor the collection of information  on alleged subsidies that are the subject of serious prejudice complaints under  the SCM Agreement was conducted.&nbsp; The  procedure was commenced on 23&nbsp;September&nbsp;2005 by the DSB, and involved,  inter alia,  the exchange of hundreds of questions and answers between the parties, under  special procedures for handling confidential and highly sensitive business  information.&nbsp; The Facilitator submitted  his report to the panel on 24 February 2006.&nbsp;  Thereafter, the panel timetable was set aside at the request of the  parties on 1 March 2006. The United States requested the panel to recommence  its work on 4&nbsp;September 2006, which it did.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 30 June 2010, the panel  report was circulated to  Members. </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The measures at issue in this dispute are more than 300 separate instances  of alleged subsidization, over a period of almost forty years, by the  European Communities and four of its member States, France, Germany, Spain and  the United Kingdom, with respect to large civil aircraft (&ldquo;LCA&rdquo;)  developed, produced and sold by the company known today as  Airbus&nbsp;SAS.&nbsp; The measures that are  the subject of the US complaint&nbsp;may&nbsp;be grouped into five general  categories: (i)&nbsp;&ldquo;Launch Aid&rdquo; or &ldquo;member State Financing&rdquo;  (LA/MSF); (ii)&nbsp;loans from the European Investment Bank;  (iii)&nbsp;infrastructure and infrastructure-related grants;  (iv)&nbsp;corporate restructuring measures; and (v)&nbsp;research and  technological development funding.&nbsp; The  United States claims that each of the challenged measures is a specific subsidy  within the meaning of Articles&nbsp;1 and 2 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement, and that  the European Communities and the four member States, through the use of these  subsidies, cause adverse effects to the US interests within the meaning of  Articles&nbsp;5 and 6 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement.&nbsp; In addition, the United States claims that  seven of the challenged LA/MSF measures are prohibited export  subsidies within the meaning of Article&nbsp;3 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> Before evaluating the  substance of the US claims, the panel resolved a number of preliminary issues,  including the temporal scope of the dispute, whether certain measures were  subject to consultations, the adequacy of the identification of measures in the  request for establishment, and requests for enhanced third party rights.&nbsp; In addition, with respect to the identity of the subsidy  recipient, the panel concluded that, notwithstanding changes in corporate  structure, Airbus SAS was the same producer of Airbus LCA as the Airbus  Industrie consortium, and that therefore all  of the alleged financial contributions provided to entities in the Airbus  Industrie consortium found to constitute subsidies would be considered to  subsidize Airbus LCA, and would be taken into account for purposes of the analysis  of adverse effects.&nbsp; The panel also  rejected the European Communities' argument that various transactions had  &ldquo;extinguished&rdquo; or &ldquo;extracted&rdquo; the benefit of subsidies, or  constituted &ldquo;withdrawal&rdquo; of subsidies.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> Turning to the  allegations of subsidization, the panel found that each of the challenged  LA/MSF measures constitutes a specific subsidy.&nbsp;  However, the panel found that the United States had failed to establish the  existence, as of&nbsp;July&nbsp;2005, of a commitment of LA/MSF for the A350  constituting a specific subsidy, and that the United States had failed to  demonstrate the existence of a &ldquo;LA/MSF Programme&rdquo;  as a distinct measure, separate from the individual grants of LA/MSF.&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally,  the panel concluded that the United States had established that the German,  Spanish and UK A380 LA/MSF measures are subsidies contingent in fact upon  anticipated export performance, and therefore prohibited export subsidies, but  that the four other measures challenge in this respect are not prohibited  export subsidies, either in law or in fact.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The panel  found that each of the 12 challenged loans provided by the European Investment  Bank (&ldquo;EIB&rdquo;) to various Airbus entities between 1988 and 2002 is a  subsidy, but that none of these subsidies was specific, and therefore dismissed  the US claims in respect of the EIB loans from further consideration.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The panel  found that the provision of (i) the M&uuml;hlenberger Loch industrial site; (ii) the  lengthened runway at the Bremen airport; and (iii) the ZAC A&eacute;roconstellation  and associated EIG facilities, constituted the provision of specific goods and  services other than &ldquo;general infrastructure&rdquo; and were specific  subsidies.&nbsp; The panel also concluded that  the challenged grants provided by national and regional authorities in Germany  and Spain for the construction of manufacturing and assembly facilities in  several locations in Germany and Spain are specific subsidies.&nbsp; However, the panel found that road  improvements by French authorities related to the ZAC A&eacute;roconstellation  industrial site were measures of general infrastructure, and thus not  subsidies, and that GBP&nbsp;19.5&nbsp;million provided to Airbus UK in respect  of its operations in Broughton, Wales, and a grant provided by the government  of Andalusia to Airbus in Puerto Santa Maria, were not specific subsidies.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The panel  found that the acquisition by Kreditanstalt  f&uuml;r Wiederaufbau (&ldquo;KfW&rdquo;) of a 20&nbsp;percent equity interest in  Deutsche Airbus in 1989 was inconsistent with the usual investment practice of  private investors in Germany, because no private investor seeking a reasonable  rate of return on its investment would have made the equity investment in  Deutsche Airbus which KfW made at the time, and that the subsequent sale of  that interest to Messerschmitt-B&ouml;lkow-Blohm  GmbH (&ldquo;MBB&rdquo;) in 1992 was for considerably less than its market  value.&nbsp; The panel therefore concluded  that both of these transactions constituted specific subsidies.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The panel  found that the United States had failed to demonstrate that the settlement by  the German government of Deutsche Airbus' accumulated debt to the German  government in 1998 conferred a benefit on Deutsche Airbus, and dismissed the US  claim in this regard.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The panel  found that four capital contributions by the French government and Cr&eacute;dit  Lyonnais to A&eacute;rospatiale between 1987 and 1994 constitute specific subsidies to  Airbus because each decision to invest in A&eacute;rospatiale was inconsistent with  the usual investment practice of private investors in France at the time, and  therefore each capital contribution is a specific subsidy.&nbsp; The panel also found that the French  government's transfer of its equity interest in Dassault Aviation to  A&eacute;rospatiale in 1998 was inconsistent with the usual investment practice of a  private investor in France at the time, and therefore is a specific subsidy.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> Having first  determined the amounts of the challenged grants at issue, the panel concluded  that (i)&nbsp;research and technological development (R&amp;TD)  grants under the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth EC Framework Programmes;  (ii) French government R&amp;TD grants between 1986 and 2005; (iii) German  Federal government R&amp;TD grants under the LuFo I, LuFo II and LuFo III  programmes; (iv) German sub-Federal government grants from the Bavarian  authorities under the OZB and Bayerisches Luftfahrtforschungsprogramm, from the  Bremen authorities under the AMST programmes, and from the Hamburg authorities  under the Luftfahrtforschungsprogramm; (v) loans under the Spanish government PROFIT  and PTA programmes; and (vi) UK government grants under the CARAD and ARP  programmes, are specific subsidies.&nbsp;  However, the panel concluded that (i) the German Federal government's commitment  to provide Airbus with a certain R&amp;TD grant under the LuFo III programme,  and (ii) certain R&amp;TD grants under the UK Technology Programme, are not  specific subsidies.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> Having  determined which of the measures challenged by the United States are specific  subsidies, the panel proceeded to evaluate whether these subsidies to Airbus  cause adverse effects to the US interests within the meaning of Articles&nbsp;5(a)  and (c) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement.&nbsp;  Specifically, the panel considered whether, through the use of these  subsidies, the European Communities, France, Germany, Spain and the United  Kingdom cause or threaten to cause: (i) &ldquo;injury&rdquo; to the US industry  producing LCA (Article&nbsp;5(a)); and (ii) &ldquo;serious prejudice&rdquo; to US  interests (Article&nbsp;5(c)), in that the effect of the subsidies is (a) to  displace or impede imports of US LCA into the EC market, (b) to displace or  impede exports of US LCA from third country markets, and (c) significant price  undercutting by EC LCA as compared with the price of US LCA in the same market,  and significant price suppression, price depression and lost sales in the same  market, within the meaning of Articles&nbsp;6.3(a), (b) and (c) of the  SCM&nbsp;Agreement.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The panel first concluded  that it was appropriate to conduct the analysis of adverse effects on the basis  of one subsidized product, all Airbus LCA, as proposed by the United States,  and that there is a single US product that is &ldquo;like&rdquo; the subsidized product, namely all Boeing LCA. &nbsp;With respect to the appropriate &ldquo;reference  period&rdquo; for the assessment of injury and serious prejudice, the panel  rejected the US view  that it was required to make the determination concerning adverse effects  &ldquo;as of&rdquo; the date of establishment of the panel in&nbsp;July&nbsp;2005.&nbsp;  The panel concluded it is charged with making a determination of &ldquo;present&rdquo;  adverse effects, taking into account all of the evidence before it, including the  most recent information available, consistent with due process, that is  relevant and reliable.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> The panel  addressed the claims with respect to serious prejudice following a &ldquo;two-step&rdquo;  approach, considering first whether the evidence demonstrated that the particular  market effects identified in Article&nbsp;6.3(a), (b) and (c) of the  SCM&nbsp;Agreement existed, and second whether any of the effects found to  exist was caused by the specific subsidies it had found.&nbsp; The panel concluded that the United States  had demonstrated the existence of displacement of imports and exports from the  European and certain third country markets, as well as significant price  depression, price suppression and lost sales, but had failed to demonstrate the  existence of significant price undercutting.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> With respect  to causation, the panel concluded that LA/MSF shifts a significant portion of  the risk of launching an aircraft from the manufacturer to the governments  supplying funding, which was in all instances on non-commercial terms, and that  Airbus' ability to launch, develop, and introduce to the market, each of its  LCA models was dependent on subsidized LA/MSF.&nbsp;  The panel found that all of the remaining specific subsidies at issue  were sufficiently linked to the product and the particular market effects in  question to make it appropriate to analyze the effects of the subsidies on an  aggregated basis.&nbsp; The panel concluded  that Airbus would have been unable to bring to the market the LCA that it  launched as and when it did but for the specific subsidies it received from the  European Communities and the governments of France, Germany, Spain and the  United Kingdom.&nbsp; The panel did not  conclude that Airbus necessarily would not exist at all but for the subsidies,  but merely that it would, at a minimum, not have been able to launch and  develop the LCA models it actually succeeded in bringing to the market.&nbsp; Thus, the panel considered that Airbus'  market presence during the period 2001-2006, as reflected in its share of the  EC and certain third country markets and the sales it won at Boeing's expense,  was clearly an effect of the subsidies in this dispute.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the panel rejected the US argument  that the specific subsidies in this dispute provided Airbus with significant  additional cash flow and other financial resources on non-market terms which  allowed it to price its aircraft more aggressively than it would otherwise be  able to without those subsidies, or that the effect of LA/MSF on cost of  capital was such that it enabled Airbus to lower prices of LCA during the  period 2001-2006.&nbsp; Therefore, the panel  concluded that the United States had failed to demonstrate that an effect of  the subsidies was the significant price depression or price suppression  observed during that period.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> Overall, the panel  concluded that the United&nbsp;States had  established that the effect of the specific subsidies found was (i)  displacement of imports of US LCA into the European market; (ii) displacement  of exports of US LCA from the markets of Australia, Brazil, China, Chinese  Taipei, Korea, Mexico, and Singapore; (iii) likely &nbsp;displacement of exports of US LCA from the  market of India; and (iv) significant lost sales in the same market, and that  these effects constituted serious prejudice to the interests of the United  States within the meaning of Article&nbsp;5(c) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement.&nbsp; However, the panel concluded that the  United&nbsp;States had not  established that the effect of the specific subsidies found was (i) significant  price undercutting; (ii) significant price suppression; and (iii) significant price  depression.&nbsp; In addition, the panel  concluded that the United States had not  established that, through the use of the subsidies, the  European Communities and certain EC member States cause or threaten to cause injury  to the US domestic industry.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">Taking  into account the nature of the prohibited subsidies it had found in this  dispute, and in the light of Article 4.7 of the SCM Agreement, the panel  recommended that the subsidizing Member granting each subsidy found to be  prohibited withdraw it without delay, specifying that this be within 90  days.&nbsp; In light of its conclusions  with respect to adverse effects, the panel recommended, pursuant to  Article&nbsp;7.8 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement, that upon adoption of its report,  or of an Appellate Body report in this dispute determining that any subsidy has  resulted in adverse effects to the interests of the United States, the Member  granting each subsidy found to have resulted in such adverse effects &ldquo;take  appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or ... withdraw the subsidy&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, the panel declined to make any suggestions  concerning steps that might be taken to implement its recommendations.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext"> On 21 July 2010, the European Union appealed to the  Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the panel report and certain legal  interpretations developed by the panel.&nbsp; On 12 August 2010, the Chairman of the  Appellate Body advised the DSB that on 5 August 2010, the European Union  requested to amend its Notice of Appeal dated 21 July 2010.&nbsp; On 11 August 2010, the Appellate Body  authorized the European Union to amend its Notice of Appeal.&nbsp; On 19 August 2010, the United&nbsp;States appealed to  the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the panel report and  certain legal interpretations developed by the panel.</p>
    <p class="paranormaltext">On 17  September 2010, the Chairman of the Appellate Body notified the DSB that it  would not be able to issue its report within 60 days due to the considerable  size of the record and the complexity of the appeal.&nbsp; The Appellate Body will hold oral hearings in  the appeal in November and December&nbsp;2010, and will provide thereafter an  estimate for circulation of the report.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body today upheld the Panel's finding that  certain subsidies provided by the European Union and certain Member state  governments to Airbus are incompatible with Article 5(c) of the <em>SCM Agreement</em> because they have caused  serious prejudice to the interests of the United States.&nbsp; The principal subsidies covered by the ruling  include financing arrangements (known as &ldquo;Launch Aid&rdquo; or &ldquo;Member  state financing&rdquo;) provided by France, Germany, Spain, and the UK for the  development of the A300, A310, A320, A330/A340, A330-200, A340-500/600, and  A380 LCA projects.&nbsp; The ruling also covers  certain equity infusions provided by the French and German governments to  companies that formed part of the Airbus consortium.&nbsp; Additionally, it covers certain  infrastructure measures provided to Airbus, namely, the lease of land at the  M&uuml;hlenberger Loch industrial site in Hamburg, the right to exclusive use of an extended  runway at Bremen airport, regional grants by the German authorities in  Nordenham, and Spanish government grants and regional grants by Andalucia and  Castilla-La Mancha in Sevilla, La Rinconada, Toledo, Puerto Santa Maria, and  Puerto Real.&nbsp; The Appellate Body&nbsp; found that the effect of the subsidies was to  displace exports of Boeing single-aisle and twin-aisle LCA from the European  Union, Chinese, and Korean markets and Boeing single-aisle LCA from the  Australian market.&nbsp; Moreover, the  Appellate Body confirmed the Panel's determination that the subsidies caused Boeing  to lose sales of LCA in the campaigns involving the  A320 (Air Asia, Air Berlin, Czech Airlines, and easyJet), A340 (Iberia, South  African Airways, and Thai Airways International), and A380 (Emirates, Qantas,  and Singapore Airlines) aircraft.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">However, for different reasons, the Appellate Body excluded  certain measures from the scope of the finding of serious prejudice.&nbsp; In particular, the finding under Article 5(c)  of the <em>SCM Agreement</em> no longer  includes the 1998 transfer of a 45.76% interest in Dassault Aviation to  A&eacute;rospatiale; the special purpose facilities at the M&uuml;hlenberger Loch  industrial site in Hamburg, A&eacute;roconstellation industrial site and associated facilities  (taxiways, parking, etc.) in Toulouse, or the various research and technology  development (R&amp;TD) measures that had been challenged by the United States  (Spanish PROFIT Programme, grants under Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth  EC Framework Programmes; 1986-1993 R&amp;TD grants by French government; <em>Luftfahrtforschungsprogramm</em> I, II, and III German grants; grants by Bavarian, Bremen, and Hamburg  authorities; civil aircraft research and development and aeronautics research programmes  by the UK government).&nbsp; The Appellate  Body also reversed the Panel's findings of displacement in Brazil, Mexico,  Singapore, and Chinese Taipei, and of threat of displacement in India.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">Moreover, the Appellate Body disagreed with the Panel&rsquo;s  views on when subsidies can be considered as being <em>de facto</em> contingent upon anticipated export performance.&nbsp; Consequently, the Appellate Body reversed the  Panel's findings that the financing provided by Germany, Spain and the UK to develop the A380 was contingent upon anticipated exportation and  thus a prohibited export subsidy under Article&nbsp;3.1(a) and footnote 4 of the <em>SCM&nbsp;Agreement</em>.&nbsp; The Appellate Body also rejected the United  States&rsquo; cross-appeal of the Panel finding that it had not been established that  certain other member State financing contracts constituted prohibited export subsidies.&nbsp; As a consequence, the Appellate Body reversed  the Panel's recommendation that the European Union withdraw prohibited  subsidies within 90 days.&nbsp; The Appellate  Body also found that the United States' claims regarding an alleged unwritten  launch aid/member State financing programme were outside its jurisdiction.&nbsp; In addition, the Appellate Body reversed the  Panel&rsquo;s findings regarding the rate of return that a market lender would have  demanded for launch aid/member State financing loans because they were not  based on an objective assessment; but found that a benefit was conferred even  on the basis of the European&nbsp;Union's calculations.&nbsp; Finally, with respect to the actionable  subsidies that have been found to cause adverse effects to the interests of the  United States, the Panel's recommendation that the European Union &ldquo;take  appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or &hellip; withdraw the subsidy&rdquo;  stands.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The Panel in this case was established in July 2005.&nbsp; The Panel circulated its Report to WTO Members  on 30 June 2010; &nbsp;and the European Union  filed a Notice of Appeal on 21 July 2010. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">A separate dispute brought by the European Union against the  United States for subsidies allegedly provided to Boeing is currently before  the Appellate Body.&nbsp; The panel report in  that dispute was circulated to WTO Members on 31 March 2011.&nbsp; Both the European Union and the United States  have appealed aspects of that panel report.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 1 June 2011, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body report.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 17 June 2011, the European  Union informed the DSB that the European Union  intended to implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings in a manner that  respected its WTO obligations, and within the time-limit set out in the SCM  Agreement. On 1 December 2011, the European Union informed the  DSB that it had taken appropriate steps to bring its measures fully  into conformity with its WTO  obligations, and to comply with the DSB's recommendations and rulings. &nbsp;By having taken appropriate steps to bring its  measures into conformity with their WTO obligations, the European  Union had ensured full  implementation of the DSB's recommendations and rulings.&nbsp; At the DSB meeting on  19 December 2011, the European Union informed  the DSB that it had taken appropriate steps to brings its measures into  conformity with its WTO obligations, as required by Article 7.8 of the SCM  Agreement and Article 19.1 of the DSU. &nbsp;The European Union said that it has serious  systemic concerns that despite its compliance report, the United  States had already made a request under Article 22.2 of the DSU to authorize  the suspension of concessions and had also initiated consultations under  Article 21.5 of the DSU. &nbsp;The United States said  that it had carefully reviewed the European Union's report on compliance but,  in its view, the steps taken by the European Union did  not bring it into compliance with the DSB's rulings. &nbsp;The European Union said that there was clearly  disagreement on compliance and that Article 21.5 of the DSU provided clear  procedures for resolving the disagreement.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Compliance proceedings</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 9 December 2011, the United States requested  consultations with the European Union pursuant  to Article 21.5 of the DSU. On 12 January 2012, the European Union and the  United States informed the DSB of Agreed Procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of  the DSU and Article&nbsp;7 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. On 30 March 2012, the United States requested the  establishment of a compliance panel.&nbsp; At its meeting on 13  April 2012, the DSB agreed to refer to the original panel, if possible, the  matter raised by the United States pertaining to this  dispute.&nbsp; Canada,  China, Japan and Korea reserved their third-party  rights. Subsequently, Australia and Brazil reserved their  third-party rights.&nbsp; On 17  April 2012, the compliance panel was composed. </p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On  13 August 2012, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that the panel,  after consultations with the parties, had adopted a timetable in which it expected  to issue its report in 2013.&nbsp; While the  timetable originally adopted was likely to be revised, in light of certain  matters being addressed by the parties, the panel continued to expect to issue  its report before the end of 2013. On 9 December 2013, the Chairman of the  panel informed the DSB that due to the substantive and procedural complexities  of this dispute, it would not be possible for the panel to complete it work in  2013. The panel expected to complete its work by the end of 2014. However, on 9  October 2014, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that due to the  substantive and procedural complexities of the dispute, and having further  reviewed the work that remains to be completed, it expected to complete its  work by the end of 2015. On 11 December 2015, the Chair of the panel informed  the DSB that due to the substantive and procedural complexities of the dispute,  and having further reviewed the work that remains to be completed, it expected  to complete its work by the end of June 2016.</p>

    	<p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                      <li class="paranormaltext">The United  States' complaint in this compliance dispute concerns the alleged failure on  the part of the European Union and certain member States to implement the  recommendations and rulings adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) in the  original proceeding <strong>EC and certain member States &ndash; Large Civil  Aircraft</strong>. <br>
&nbsp;                      </li>
                      <li class="paranormaltext">The  United&nbsp;States maintained that the European&nbsp;Union and certain member  States failed to comply with the DSB recommendations and rulings for two main  reasons. First, the United&nbsp;States claimed that the European&nbsp;Union and  certain member States failed to act in conformity with the obligation in  Article 7.8 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement to &ldquo;take appropriate steps to remove  the adverse effects&rdquo; or &ldquo;withdraw the subsidy&rdquo; because not only do  the subsidies found to have caused adverse effects in the original proceeding  continue to cause adverse effects today, but also because by agreeing to  provide Airbus with LA/MSF for Airbus' latest model of LCA, the A350XWB,  France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom &ldquo;continued and even  expanded&rdquo; the subsidization of Airbus' LCA activities, thereby causing  &ldquo;additional adverse effects&rdquo; to the United States' interests, within  the meaning of Articles 5(c) and 6.3 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. Second, the  United&nbsp;States claimed that France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom  failed to comply with the recommendations and rulings adopted by the DSB  because, according to the United&nbsp;States, the A350XWB LA/MSF measures are prohibited  export and/or import substitution subsidies, within the meaning of Articles 3.1  and 3.2 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement, claims that the United&nbsp;States also made  in relation to the A380 LA/MSF subsidies.<br>
&nbsp;                      </li>
                      <li class="paranormaltext">The  European&nbsp;Union rejected the entirety of the United&nbsp;States' claims. In  particular, the European&nbsp;Union maintained that the subsidies found to  cause adverse effects in the original proceeding had either been  &ldquo;withdrawn&rdquo; or were no longer a &ldquo;genuine and substantial&rdquo; cause  of &ldquo;adverse effects&rdquo;. Moreover, the European&nbsp;Union argued that  the United&nbsp;States' claims against the A350XWB LA/MSF measures and the  prohibited subsidy claims the United&nbsp;States raised against the A380 LA/MSF  subsidies were outside of the scope of the compliance proceeding or, in any  case, without merit.<br>
&nbsp;                      </li>
                      <li class="paranormaltext">The Panel addressed  the parties' submissions in four main parts: First, the Panel reviewed the  European Union's compliance communication of 1 December 2011, in which the  European Union had identified 36 alleged compliance &ldquo;steps&rdquo;; second, the  Panel evaluated the merits of the European Union's contention that the A350XWB  LA/MSF measures and certain claims made by the United States did not fall within  the scope of the compliance proceeding; third, the Panel considered whether the  United States had established that the LA/MSF measures for the A350XWB and the  A380 constituted prohibited subsidies, within the meaning of Articles 3.1 and  3.2 of the SCM Agreement; and fourth, the Panel determined the merits of the United  States' claim that the European Union and certain member States failed to &ldquo;withdraw&rdquo;  the subsidies or &ldquo;take appropriate steps to remove the adverse  effects&rdquo;, within the meaning of Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement.&nbsp; </li>
                    </ol>
        <p><strong>The European Union's Compliance Communication</strong></p>
        <ol start="5">
                      <li class="paranormaltext">The Panel considered  that of the 36 alleged compliance &ldquo;steps&rdquo; listed by the  European&nbsp;Union in its communication to the DSB of 1 December 2011, only  two could be properly characterized as actions relating to the degree of ongoing  subsidization of Airbus LCA. The Panel considered that the remaining 34 alleged  compliance &ldquo;steps&rdquo; notified by the European Union represented the <em>assertion of facts</em> or <em>presentation of arguments</em> for the  purpose of supporting the European&nbsp;Union's theory of compliance based on  the following main contentions: (a) the adopted rulings and recommendations  give rise to no compliance obligation at all, under the terms of Article 7.8 of  the SCM&nbsp;Agreement, with respect to &ldquo;expired&rdquo; subsidies; (b) an &ldquo;expired&rdquo;  subsidy means that it has been &ldquo;withdrawn&rdquo; for the purpose of Article  7.8 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement; (c) an &ldquo;expired&rdquo; subsidy cannot cause  adverse effects in the context of a proceeding initiated under Article 21.5 of  the DSU; and (d) the passage of time, and events that have taken place over the  passage of time, have diluted the causal link established in the original  proceeding such that the challenged subsidies are no longer a &ldquo;genuine and  substantial&rdquo; cause of adverse effects in the post-implementation period.  Thus, the Panel found that apart from the two &ldquo;actions&rdquo; identified above,  the European&nbsp;Union's affirmation of compliance was not grounded in any  specific conduct on the part of the European&nbsp;Union and certain member  States with respect to the subsidies provided to Airbus or the adverse effects  those subsidies were found to have caused in the original proceeding. The Panel  concluded that, fundamentally, the European&nbsp;Union's view that it had  achieved full compliance was, rather, based on its understanding of the scope  and nature of the obligations arising out of the adopted recommendations and  rulings as well as its own interpretation of the applicable law and legal  provisions, including Article 7.8 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Whether the A350XWB LA/MSF  Measures Fell within the Scope of the Compliance Proceeding</strong></p>
                    <ol start="6">
                      <li class="paranormaltext">Drawing from  established WTO jurisprudence concerning the extent to which measures that are  not &ldquo;declared&rdquo; &ldquo;measures taken to comply&rdquo; may be challenged  in a compliance proceeding, the Panel found that the <em>nature</em>, <em>effect</em> and <em>timing</em> of the A350XWB LA/MSF measures evidenced  the existence of a &ldquo;particularly close relationship&rdquo; (a &ldquo;close  nexus&rdquo;) between the A350XWB LA/MSF measures, the &ldquo;declared&rdquo; &ldquo;measures taken to comply&rdquo; and the adopted recommendations and  rulings from the original proceeding. In particular, the Panel found that the  A350XWB LA/MSF measures had a similar <em>nature</em> to the pre-A350XWB LA/MSF measures because they were all: (a) <em>loan </em>agreements; (b) containing the <em>same four &ldquo;core&rdquo; repayment terms</em>;  (c) entered into by essentially <em>the same  parties</em> (Airbus and the Airbus governments); and (d) for the purpose of <em>financing part of the development costs of  Airbus LCA (in particular, a new model of Airbus twin-aisle LCA). </em>The Panel  also determined that the <em>effects</em> of  the A350XWB LA/MSF measures <em>could</em> undermine the European&nbsp;Union's compliance with the adopted rulings and  recommendations because it was anticipated that the A350XWB would replace the  A330 and A340 (both of which had been: (a) launched, developed and brought to  market with the assistance of pre-A350XWB LA/MSF; and (b) sold into a customer  space in which the United&nbsp;States' LCA industry was found to have suffered  serious prejudice in the original proceeding). Finally, the Panel concluded  that the fact that the A350XWB LA/MSF measures were concluded <em>before</em> the recommendations and rulings  were adopted by the DSB (and, therefore, before the European Union incurred a  compliance obligation) did not sever the link it had found to exist in terms of  the <em>nature</em> and <em>effects</em> of the A350XWB LA/MSF measures, the adopted recommendations  and rulings, and the European&nbsp;Union's alleged compliance  &ldquo;actions&rdquo;.<br>
&nbsp;                      </li>
                      <li class="paranormaltext">Accordingly,  the Panel found that the United&nbsp;States had established that the A350XWB  LA/MSF measures satisfied the &ldquo;close nexus&rdquo; test and, therefore, that  they were &ldquo;closely connected&rdquo; with the adopted DSB recommendations  and rulings and the European&nbsp;Union's alleged compliance  &ldquo;actions&rdquo;, such that they should be brought within the scope of the  proceeding.</li>
                    </ol>
        <p><strong>Prohibited subsidy claims</strong></p>
                    <ol start="8">
                      <li class="paranormaltext">The first part  of the Panel's evaluation of the United States' prohibited subsidy claims  against the A350XWB LA/MSF measures was focused on determining the merits of  the United States' claim that each measure amounted to a specific subsidy,  within the meaning of Articles 1 and 2 of the SCM Agreement. <br>
&nbsp;                      </li>
                      <li class="paranormaltext">The United  States argued that each of the A350XWB LA/MSF measures entered into by Airbus  and France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, was a &ldquo;financial  contribution&rdquo; in the form of a &ldquo;loan&rdquo;, within the meaning of  Article 1.1(a)(1)(i) of the SCM Agreement, that conferred a &ldquo;benefit&rdquo;  on Airbus, within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement, by virtue  of the below-market interest rates Airbus was charged for the financing. The  European Union did not contest the United States' characterization of the LA/MSF  measures as &ldquo;financial contributions&rdquo;. However, according to the  European Union, the A350XWB LA/MSF measures did not confer a  &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; upon Airbus because the United States could not show that the  financing was provided at below-market interest rates. <br>
&nbsp;                      </li>
                      <li class="paranormaltext">After  constructing the relevant market interest rate benchmarks, the Panel compared  the results with the internal rates of return determined for each of the  relevant LA/MSF contracts and found that, in each case, the rates of return  were, to differing degrees, below the market interest rate benchmark. Thus, the  Panel found that the A350XWB LA/MSF measures were provided at below-market  interest rates. Accordingly, the Panel concluded that the terms of the A350XWB  LA/MSF measures conferred a &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; upon Airbus, making them  subsidies, within the meaning of Article 1 of the SCM Agreement.<br>
&nbsp;                      </li>
                      <li class="paranormaltext">The Panel next  turned to evaluate the merits of the United States' prohibited subsidy claims  against the A380 LA/MSF measures and the A350XWB LA/MSF measures. The Panel dismissed  the United States' claims.<br>
&nbsp;                      </li>
                      <li class="paranormaltext">Although the  compliance Panel found that the United States had demonstrated that the  challenged measures were subsidiesgranted  in anticipation of export performance, the Panel found that the United States  had not demonstrated that the granting of those subsidies was, in fact, <em>contingent</em> upon export performance. Accordingly,  the Panel found that the United States failed to demonstrate that the A380 and  A350XWB LA/MSF measures constitute prohibited export subsidies within the  meaning of Article 3.1(a) and footnote 4 of the SCM Agreement.<br>
&nbsp;                      </li>
                      <li class="paranormaltext">The Panel also  rejected the United States' claim that the A350XWB LA/MSF measures are  prohibited import substitution subsidies, to the extent that they explicitly  provide for the granting of subsidies contingent upon Airbus producing certain  domestic LCA-related goods, which are subsequently assembled or used to make  Airbus LCA. The Panel found that even if the A350XWB LA/MSF contracts were  contingent on the domestic <em>production</em> of certain LCA-related goods that were then used in the production of Airbus  LCA, as the United States claimed, this fact alone could not establish that the  subsidy measures were <em>contingent</em>,  whether in law or in fact, on the use of domestic over imported goods. The Panel  noted that all domestic production subsidies could in one way or another  increase the consumption of domestically produced goods by downstream entities.  In this context, the Panel considered that the United States' theory of  contingency could result in many domestic production subsidies being considered  prohibited import substitution subsidies. The Panel considered such a result to  be particularly questionable given that Article III:8(b) of the GATT 1994  explicitly provides that the practice of a WTO member granting subsidies  exclusively to domestic producers (i.e. domestic production subsidies) should  not be disciplined under Article III:4 of the GATT 1994, which, like Article  3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement, also prohibits import substitution subsidies. <br>
&nbsp;                      </li>
                      <li class="paranormaltext">Accordingly,  the Panel concluded that the United States failed to demonstrate that the  A350XWB LA/MSF measures were prohibited import substitution subsidies within  the meaning of Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement. &nbsp;</li>

        <p><strong>Whether the European Union complied with the obligation  to &ldquo;take appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects&rdquo; or &ldquo;withdraw  the subsidy&rdquo;, pursuant to Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement</strong></p>
                    <ol start="15">
                      <li class="paranormaltext">Article 7.8 of  the SCM Agreement specifies what an implementing Member must do following the  adoption of a panel and/or Appellate&nbsp;Body report in which it is determined  that any specific subsidy has caused adverse effects to the interests of  another Member, within the meaning of Article 5 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. In  particular, Article 7.8 calls upon the &ldquo;Member granting or maintaining  such subsidy&rdquo; to &ldquo;take appropriate steps to remove the adverse  effects or withdraw the subsidy&rdquo;. The difficult interpretative question  that was at the centre of the United States' claims of non-compliance in this  dispute was how to give meaning to this requirement in the context of the  substantive disciplines of Article 5 of the SCM Agreement, which focus not on  the <em>existence</em> of a particular type of  measure (as other disciplines found in the covered agreements), but rather on  the <em>trade effects</em> that may be  attributed to a measure, <em>whether or not  it continues to exist</em>. </li>
                    </ol>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Whether the United States demonstrated that the European  Union and certain member States had failed to &ldquo;withdraw the subsidy&rdquo;</strong></p>
                    <ol start="16">
                      <li class="paranormaltext">The Panel  concluded that the European&nbsp;Union had established  that the anticipated (<em>ex ante</em>) &ldquo;lives&rdquo;  of the French, German and Spanish LA/MSF subsidies for the A300B/B2/B4,  A300-600, A310, A320, A330/A340, and the UK LA/MSF subsidies for the A320 and  A330/A340, all came to an end before the end of the implementation period. Furthermore,  the Panel also found that the European&nbsp;Union had demonstrated that the <em>ex ante</em> &ldquo;lives&rdquo; of the French  and German government capital contribution subsidies came to an end before the  end of the implementation period. The Panel was satisfied that the  European&nbsp;Union had shown that the <em>ex  ante</em> &ldquo;lives&rdquo; of these subsidies had &ldquo;expired&rdquo; <em>not</em> because they were somehow brought to  a <em>premature</em> end by, for example,  having been repaid or because of the alignment of their terms with a market  benchmark, but rather because the total period of time over which their  &ldquo;projected value&rdquo; was expected to &ldquo;materialize&rdquo; had <em>passively</em> transpired in the absence of  any &ldquo;intervening event&rdquo;. In other words, the Panel found that the <em>ex ante</em> &ldquo;lives&rdquo; of the relevant  subsidies had &quot;expired&quot; simply because they had been fully provided  to Airbus as originally planned and expected. With respect to all other  subsidies at issue in this dispute, the Panel found that the  European&nbsp;Union had failed to demonstrate that they &ldquo;expired&rdquo;, or  were &ldquo;extinguished&rdquo; or &ldquo;extracted&rdquo;, before the end of the  implementation period.<br>
&nbsp;                      </li>
                      <li class="paranormaltext">The Panel  recalled that, in dismissing the European Union's contention that Article 7.8  imposed no compliance obligation on the European Union and certain member  States in relation to subsidies that ceased to exist prior to 1 June 2011, it had  found that one of the fundamental objectives of Article 7.8 is to bring an  implementing Member into conformity with its obligations under Article 5 of the  SCM&nbsp;Agreement. According to the Panel, the logical implication of this  finding was that it cannot be concluded on the <em>sole</em> basis of the &ldquo;expiry&rdquo; of the relevant LA/MSF and  capital contribution subsidies that the European&nbsp;Union and certain member  States had <em>ipso facto</em> complied with  the obligation to &ldquo;withdraw the subsidy&rdquo; with respect to those  measures. Rather, in the light of the effects-based nature of the subsidy  disciplines of Article 5, the Panel was of the view that the extent to which  the <em>passive</em> &ldquo;expiry&rdquo; events  may be found to amount to the &ldquo;withdrawal&rdquo; of subsidies for the  purpose of Article 7.8 will depend upon the extent to which they bring the  European&nbsp;Union and certain member States into conformity with Article 5 of  the SCM&nbsp;Agreement.<br>
&nbsp;                      </li>
                      <li class="paranormaltext">Accordingly,  the Panel found that the European Union had failed to demonstrate that the mere  fact that the &ldquo;lives&rdquo; of certain subsidies had expired before the end  of the implementation period <em>ipso facto</em> implied that the European Union and certain member States had complied with the  obligation to &ldquo;withdraw the subsidy&rdquo; for the purpose of Article 7.8.  Thus, the Panel found that the United States had established that the European  Union and certain member States had failed to &ldquo;withdraw&rdquo; the  subsidies, for the purpose of Article 7.8.</li>

<p class="paranormaltext">On
21 December 2016, the Appellate Body informed the DSB that it would not be able
to circulate the Appellate Body report in this appeal by the end of the 60-day

          <div class="panel-body">

    	      <p><strong>A350XWB  subsidies:</strong> The Appellate Body upheld the Panel's  finding that Airbus paid a lower interest rate for the A350XWB LA/MSF than  would have been available to it on the market and, consequently, a benefit was thereby conferred within  the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. The Appellate Body  also upheld the Panel's finding that each of the French, German, Spanish, and  UK A350XWB LA/MSF contracts constitutes a subsidy within the meaning of the SCM  Agreement.</p>
    	      <p><strong>Prohibited  (import substitution) subsidies:</strong> The Appellate Body  agreed with the Panel that the fact that&nbsp;a subsidy results in the use of  domestic over imported goods cannot by itself demonstrate that that subsidy is  contingent on the use of domestic over imported goods, whether in law or in  fact.The Appellate Body dealt with a  similar claim in <strong>United&nbsp;States &mdash;  Conditional Tax Incentives for Large Civil Aircraft</strong>. Based on its analysis,  the Appellate Body upheld the Panel's finding that the United States had failed  to establish that the subsidies at issue are prohibited import substitution  subsidies. The Panel finding rejecting the claim alleging prohibited subsidies  contingent on export performance was not appealed.</p>
    	      <p><strong>Compliance  obligation under Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement with respect to expired  subsidies:</strong> The Appellate Body agreed with the  European Union that an implementing Member cannot be required to  &ldquo;withdraw&rdquo; a subsidy that no longer exists, or to &ldquo;remove&rdquo;  the &ldquo;effects&rdquo; of such subsidies that do not exist. The Appellate Body  therefore disagreed with the manner in which the Panel characterized the scope  of the compliance obligation under Article&nbsp;7.8 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement.  Rather, having upheld the Panel's finding that certain LA/MSF subsidies had  expired before the end of the implementation period on  1&nbsp;December&nbsp;2011, the Appellate Body found that the  European&nbsp;Union had no compliance obligation with respect to these  subsidies. The Appellate Body underscored that the pertinent question for purposes of these compliance proceedings was  whether the subsidies existing in the post&#8209;implementation period  (i.e.&nbsp;after 1 December 2011) caused adverse effects. </p>
    	      <p><strong>Adverse effects</strong>: The Appellate Body upheld the Panel's  finding that the United&nbsp;States had brought its adverse effects claims with  respect to appropriately defined product markets for LCA, namely, the global  markets for single-aisle LCA, twin&#8209;aisle LCA, and very large aircraft. The  Appellate Body then focused its review on the Panel's analysis and findings  regarding the effects of the subsidies existing in the post-implementation  period, that is, essentially the A380 LA/MSF and the A350XWB LA/MSF subsidies.  The Appellate Body disagreed with the European&nbsp;Union's claim that the  Panel erred in its analysis regarding the &ldquo;product effects&rdquo; of these  subsidies, that is, the effects of these subsidies on Airbus' ability to bring  the A380 and A350XWB to the market as and when it did. Rather, in the Appellate  Body's view, the Panel's findings, as well as relevant findings from the  original proceedings, establish that the LA/MSF subsidies existing in the  post-implementation period made it possible for Airbus to proceed with the  timely launch of the A350XWB and to bring to market the A380, and that both  events were crucial to renew and sustain Airbus' competitiveness in the post&#8209;implementation  period. The Appellate Body subsequently considered whether the &ldquo;product  effects&rdquo; of the LA/MSF subsidies existing in the post-implementation  period, in light of the competition in the relevant product markets as  determined by the Panel, supported the conclusion that the LA/MSF subsidies  caused adverse effects in the form of significant lost sales, displacement, and  impedance of&nbsp;US&nbsp;LCA.</p>
    	      <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Based on its review of the Panel's analysis, the  Appellate Body ultimately upheld the Panel's conclusion that insofar as  significant lost sales in the twin-aisle markets (in which Airbus  and Boeing sell the A330, A350XWB, 767, 777, and 787 product families) and  significant lost sales and impedance in the <strong>very large aircraft</strong> markets (the A380 and 747) are concerned, the European&nbsp;Union had failed to  comply with the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in the original dispute  because the underlying subsidies continued to exist and cause adverse effects.  The Appellate Body, however, did not uphold the Panel's findings of  displacement in these two markets or its finding of impedance in the twin-aisle  market. With regard to the market for <strong>single-aisle aircraft</strong> (in which the A320  and Boeing 737 compete), the Appellate Body observed that the Panel's findings  concerned primarily the effects of subsidies that had <strong>expired</strong> before 1&nbsp;December 2011 (the time by which the European  Union had been required to comply with the recommendations and rulings of the  DSB in the original dispute). The Appellate Body was not convinced that the  Panel's analysis in this regard provided a sufficient basis to find that  subsidies provided to Airbus continued to cause adverse effects in the market  for single-aisle aircraft.</p>

	<p> On this basis, <strong>in  respect of subsidies existing in the post-implementation period</strong>, the  Appellate Body upheld, albeit for different reasons, the Panel's conclusions  that &ldquo;{b}y continuing to be in violation of Articles&nbsp;5(c) and 6.3(a),  (b) and (c) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement&rdquo; insofar as the twin-aisle LCA and  VLA markets are concerned, &ldquo;the European&nbsp;Union and certain member  States have failed to comply with the DSB recommendations and rulings and &hellip; the  obligation under Article&nbsp;7.8 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement &lsquo;to take  appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or &hellip; withdraw the  subsidy&rsquo;&rdquo;; and that, &ldquo;{t}o&nbsp;the extent that the European Union  and certain member States have failed to comply with the recommendations and  rulings of the DSB in the original dispute, those recommendations and rulings  remain operative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At its meeting on 28 May 2018, the DSB  adopted the Appellate Body report and the panel report, as modified by the  Appellate Body report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3> Implementation following compliance  proceedings</h3>
<p> On 17 May 2018, the European Union informed  the DSB that it had taken the appropriate steps to bring its measures into  conformity with its WTO obligations, and to comply with the DSB's  recommendations and rulings.</p>
<p>On 21  August 2020, the European Union informed the DSB that it amended the French  A350XWB MSF and the Spanish A350XWB MSF loan agreements so as to align the terms  of these financial instruments on a market benchmark prevailing at the time of  the original measure, with prospective effect from the date of the amendment.  In the European Union's view, these measures achieve full compliance with the  findings of the compliance panel report of 2 December 2019. The European Union explained  that it had adopted these measures in spite of having appealed the findings of  the compliance panel report and disagreeing with some of the findings in the  Arbitrator's decision of 2 October 2019, in an effort to avoid mutually assured  retaliation in the current economic climate, and rapidly reach the point at  which there are no countermeasures applied on either side. The European Union  considered this to be the first step to both parties moving in that direction  and believed that the next step should be to achieve the absence of  countermeasures on both sides.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Proceedings under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 9 December 2011, the United States, being  of the view that the European Union and certain member  States had failed to comply with the DSB's recommendations and rulings, requested  authorization by the DSB to  take countermeasures under Article 22 of the DSU and Article 7.9 of the SCM  Agreement.&nbsp; At  the DSB meeting on 22 December 2011, the European Union objected to the level  of suspension of concessions or other obligations contained in the United  States' request and claimed that the principles and procedures set forth in  Article 22.3 of the DSU had not been followed.&nbsp;  The European Union also stated that the United States' proposal is not  allowed under the covered agreements. The European Union requested the matter  be referred to arbitration under Article 22.6 of the DSU.&nbsp; The DSB agreed that the matter raised by the  European Union in its statement at that meeting was referred to arbitration as  required by Article 22.6 of the DSU.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 19&nbsp;January&nbsp;2012, the United States  and the European Union requested the Arbitrator to suspend its work.&nbsp; As stated in paragraph 6 of the Agreed  Procedures, in the event that the DSB, following a proceeding under Article  21.5 of the DSU, rules that the measure taken to comply does not exist or is  inconsistent with a covered agreement, either party may request the Article  22.6 arbitrator to resume its work.&nbsp; In  accordance with the parties' joint request, the Arbitrator suspended the  arbitration proceedings from 20 January 2012 until either party requests their  resumption.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">Following  the resignation of the Chair of the Arbitrator and the unavailability of one of  the members of the Arbitrator, on 28 June 2018, the United States requested the  Director-General to appoint a new Chair and a new member of the Arbitrator. On 9 July 2018 the Director-General  composed the Arbitrator.</p>

<p class="paranormaltext">On 17  July 2018, the Chair of the Arbitrator informed the DSB that, on 13 July 2018,  the United States requested the resumption of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s work. The  Arbitrator therefore resumed its work as of 13 July 2018.</p>
	      <p class="paranormaltext"><a  id="bkmk316arb" name="bkmk316arb"></a>On 2 October 2019, the Arbitrator circulated its Decision to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>The subsidies at issue in this  proceeding were actionable subsidies disciplined under Part III of the SCM  Agreement. The Arbitrator determined that the level of countermeasures  &ldquo;commensurate with the degree and nature of the adverse effects determined  to exist&rdquo;, in the December 2011-2013 reference period (which was the same  reference period used in the compliance proceedings) within the meaning of  Article 7.10 of the SCM Agreement, amounts to USD 7,496.623 million <em>per annum</em>. Therefore, the Arbitrator  concluded that the United States may request authorization from the DSB to take  countermeasures with respect to the European Union and certain member States,  as indicated in document WT/DS316/18, at a level not exceeding, in total, USD  7,496.623 million annually. </p>
            <p>These countermeasures may take the  form of (a) suspension of tariff concessions and related obligations under the  GATT&nbsp;1994, and/or (b) suspension of horizontal or sectoral commitments and  obligations contained in the United&nbsp;States' services schedule with regard  to all services defined in the Services Sectoral Classification List, except  for financial services.</p>

<p class="paranormaltext">On 2 October 2019, with reference to the  Decision of the Arbitrator, the United States requested authorization from the  DSB, pursuant to Article 7.9 of the SCM Agreement and Article 22.7 of the DSU,  to take countermeasures with respect to the European Union and certain member  States (Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom) at a level not  exceeding, in total, US&nbsp;$&nbsp;7,496.623 million annually. The United  States informed that the countermeasures would take the form of (a) suspension  of tariff concessions and related obligations to the European Union under the  GATT 1994 and/or (b) suspension of horizontal or sectoral commitments and  obligations contained in the United States' services schedule with regard to  all services defined in the Services  Sectoral Classification List, except for financial services. At  its meeting on 14 October 2019, the DSB authorized the suspension of  concessions.</p>

<h3>Compliance proceedings (recourse by the  European Union)</h3>
<p> On 29 May 2018, the European Union  requested consultations with the United States pursuant to Article 21.5 of the  DSU with respect to a disagreement regarding the existence or consistency with  the WTO covered agreements of measures taken by the European Union to comply  with the DSB's recommendations and rulings in this dispute. On 31 July 2018, the European Union requested the  establishment of a compliance panel. At its meeting on 15 August 2018, the DSB  deferred the establishment of a compliance panel.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 27 August 2018, the DSB agreed, pursuant  to Article 21.5 of the DSU, to refer to the original panel, if possible, the  matter raised by the European Union. Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan and  the Russian Federation reserved their third-party rights.</p>
<p>Given the unavailability of two members  of the original panel, on 17 September 2018, the European Union requested the  Director-General to determine the composition of the compliance panel. On  28&nbsp;September&nbsp;2018, the Director-General composed the compliance  panel.</p>
<p>On  16 November 2018, the Chair of the compliance panel informed the DSB that due  to the complexity of the dispute, the compliance panel did not expect to  complete its work before the end of 2019.</p>

    	    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
            <p>This  proceeding concerns the European Union's request that the Panel find that it,  and certain member States, have achieved full substantive compliance with the  DSB's recommendations and rulings in the original and first compliance  proceedings in <strong>EC and certain member  States &mdash; Large Civil Aircraft</strong>.</p>
            <p>The  European Union asserted that it had achieved compliance through the adoption of  a series of 18 additional measures that, in its view, constituted &ldquo;appropriate  steps to address the remaining and additional elements of the DSB's  recommendations and rulings, either through the withdrawal of subsidies or the  removal of the adverse effects&rdquo;. The 18 &ldquo;steps&rdquo; included  amendments made to the original LA/MSF loan agreements between Airbus and  France, Germany, Spain and the United&nbsp;Kingdom used to fund the development  of the A380 LCA; an amendment to the German  LA/MSF agreement to fund development of the A350XWB LCA; and the alleged  repayment of outstanding principal and interest of the UK LA/MSF loan agreement  used to fund development of the A350XWB.</p>
            <p>The United States rejected the entirety of the European Union' claims.  Rather than achieving compliance, the United States maintained that the  actions identified by the European Union have increased the amount of the  subsidies provided to Airbus and prolonged their lives rather than achieving  compliance or removing the adverse effects that the LA/MSF subsidies were found  to cause. Moreover, the United States asked the Panel to find that the European  Union has failed to achieve full substantive compliance with the DSB's  recommendations and rulings by maintaining certain research and technological  development subsidies, which the United&nbsp;States argued alone or together  with the LA/MSF subsidies at issue, continue to cause adverse effects to the  United States' interests. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Whether the United States'  claims against certain research and technological development (R&amp;TD)  measures are outside the Panel's terms of reference</strong></p>
            <p>The European Union argued that the  United States' complaint against the R&amp;TD measures was not within the  Panel's terms of reference because the R&amp;TD measures were not identified in  the European Union's panel request. In the absence of any reference to the  specific R&amp;TD measures in the European Union's panel request, the European  Union argued that the proper course of action for the United States would have  been to follow the guidance of the Appellate Body in <strong>US&nbsp;&mdash; Continued Suspension/Canada &mdash; Continued Suspension</strong>, and  initiate its own Article 21.5 proceeding in which the United States could have  raised its specific complaint against those measures.</p>
            <p>The Panel found that the panel and Appellate Body reports in the <strong>Continued Suspension</strong> disputes do not  provide clear guidance for determining whether the United States is entitled to  have the merits of its claims against the R&amp;TD measures examined in this  &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; Article 21.5 dispute. Ultimately, the Panel determined that  it was not necessary to decide this legal question, because even assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, that the absence of any  reference to the challenged R&amp;TD measures in the European Union's panel  request could not prevent the United States from raising claims, the Panel considered that it would  be precluded from addressing them on other procedural grounds. In particular, the  Panel concluded that the United States was not entitled to raise claims in this  second compliance proceeding against the R&amp;TD measures that were the  subject of findings in the original proceeding, as well as those more recent  R&amp;TD measures, which were not addressed in the original proceeding, but  could have been challenged by the United States in the first compliance proceeding.  The Panel further found that the United States has failed to establish that the most recent R&amp;TD measures have &ldquo;sufficiently  close links&rdquo; with the relevant measures taken to comply and the DSB's&nbsp;recommendations  and rulings such that it would be appropriate to characterize them as &ldquo;measures  taken to comply&rdquo;.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Whether the European Union  demonstrated that the A350XWB and A380 LA/MSF subsidies have been withdrawn for  the purpose of Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement</strong></p>
            <p>The Panel found that the European Union failed to  demonstrate that it had achieved the withdrawal of the French, German, Spanish  and UK A380 LA/MSF subsidies, or the German and UK A350XWB LA/MSF subsidies,  for purposes of Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement. In particular, the Panel  concluded the following:            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The European Union failed to demonstrate that  modifications to the original German A350XWB LA/MSF loan agreement meant that  the pre-existing subsidy had been &ldquo;replaced&rdquo; by a new and different  loan, which resulted in the &ldquo;withdrawal&rdquo; of the subsidy; </li>
              <li>The European Union demonstrated that Airbus had repaid  all outstanding principal and interest accrued under the UK A350XWB LA/MSF  contract. However, the Panel rejected the European Union's argument that the  repayment of a loan on subsidized terms would on its own bring the life of a  subsidy to an end for the purpose of a Member's compliance obligations under  Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement; and</li>
              <li>The European Union failed to demonstrate that  amendments to the four A380 LA/MSF agreements achieved the withdrawal of the subsidies  conferred under those agreements. Specifically, the Panel concluded that the  European Union failed to demonstrate that a commercial lender, faced with the  likely termination of the A380 programme, would have entered into the A380  LA/MSF amendments on the terms agreed between Airbus and the relevant member  State governments, to achieve the withdrawal of the pre-existing subsidies by  aligning their terms with a market benchmark. The Panel also rejected the  European&nbsp;Union's additional argument that the Spanish A380 LA/MSF subsidy has  been withdrawn as a result of the alleged amortization of benefit of the  pre-existing subsidy. Finally, the Panel rejected the European Union's argument  that Airbus' announcement to &ldquo;wind down&rdquo; the A380&nbsp;programme at  present achieved the withdrawal of the French, German, Spanish and UK&nbsp;A380  LA/MSF subsidies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left"><strong>Whether the European Union and  certain member States had failed to &ldquo;take appropriate steps to remove the  adverse effects&rdquo;</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The Panel found that the European Union and  certain member States failed to &ldquo;take appropriate steps to remove the  adverse effects&rdquo; because:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In the VLA product market, the  &ldquo;product&rdquo; effects of the LA/MSF subsidies are a &ldquo;genuine and  substantial&rdquo; cause of the impedance of the exports of a like product of  the United States from Singapore and the United Arab Emirates within the  meaning of Article&nbsp;6.3(b) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement, constituting serious  prejudice to the interests of the United&nbsp;States within the meaning of  Article&nbsp;5(c) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement;</li>
              <li>In the twin-aisle product market, the  &ldquo;product&rdquo; effects of the LA/MSF subsidies are a &ldquo;genuine and  substantial&rdquo; cause of impedance of the imports of a like product of the  United States into the European Union within the meaning of Article 6.3(a) of  the SCM Agreement, and are a &ldquo;genuine and substantial&rdquo; cause of the  impedance of the exports of a like product of the United States from China,  Korea, and Singapore within the meaning of Article 6.3(b) of the SCM Agreement,  constituting serious prejudice to the interests of the United&nbsp;States  within the meaning of Article&nbsp;5(c) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement; and </li>
              <li>In the twin-aisle product market, the  &quot;product&quot; effects of the LA/MSF subsidies are a &ldquo;genuine and  substantial&rdquo; cause of significant lost sales to the US LCA industry in the  global market for twin-aisle LCA within the meaning of Article 6.3(c) of the  SCM Agreement, constituting serious prejudice to the interests of the  United&nbsp;States within the meaning of Article&nbsp;5(c) of the  SCM&nbsp;Agreement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left"><strong>Overall conclusion</strong></p>
            <p align="left">The Panel therefore concluded that the European  Union and certain member States failed to implement the recommendations and  rulings of the DSB to bring its measures into conformity with its obligations  under the SCM Agreement, and to this extent, that the adopted recommendations  and rulings remained operative.</p>
