            <p>The dispute concerned  anti-dumping measures maintained by Ukraine on imports of ammonium nitrate from  Russia. The Ukrainian authorities had originally imposed anti-dumping measures  on these imports following an anti-dumping investigation, which they extended pursuant  to an interim and expiry review determination. Russia made substantive and  procedural claims challenging the Ukrainian authorities' review determinations,  while also challenging some aspects of the determinations made in the original  investigation.</p>
            <p>With respect to the substantive  claims, Russia challenged the Ukrainian authorities' dumping and  likelihood-of-dumping determinations, injury-related aspects of their  determination, and their decision to include a Russian producer, that allegedly  had a <em>de minimis dumping margin</em> in  the original investigation phase, within the scope of the review determination.</p>
            <p>Regarding the dumping and  likelihood-of-dumping determinations, Russia contended that the Ukrainian  authorities violated Articles 2.2.1.1 and 2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement by  rejecting the prices paid by the investigated Russian producers for gas used to  produce ammonium nitrate. Russia also challenged under the same provisions the  Ukrainian authorities' decision to replace these prices with a surrogate gas price  that Russia argued did not reflect the cost of gas in Russia. Ukraine argued  that its authorities were justified in rejecting these producers' gas prices  because they were distorted due to government control of gas prices, and that  its authorities made appropriate adjustments in selecting the surrogate price  of gas to ensure that it reflected costs in Russia. The Panel found that the  Ukrainian authorities violated Article 2.2.1.1 in rejecting the gas prices of  Russian producers as they did not provide an adequate basis to justify this  decision. The Panel found that the Ukrainian authorities violated Article 2.2  because they did not make sufficient adjustments to ensure that the surrogate  gas price reflected costs in Russia. The Panel also upheld a claim by Russia  under Article 2.2.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement alleging that inconsistencies  with cost calculations under Article 2.2.1.1 distorted the ordinary-course-of-trade  test conducted by the Ukrainian authorities under Article 2.2.1. Further, the  Panel found that by relying on dumping margins calculated inconsistently with  Articles 2.2, 2.2.1 and 2.2.1.1 to make their likelihood-of-dumping  determinations, the Ukrainian authorities also violated Articles 11.2 and 11.3  of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.</p>
            <p>With respect to injury-related  aspects of the Ukrainian authorities' review determination, Russia had claimed in  its panel request that these authorities violated Articles 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3  of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because they determined and relied on injury not  established in accordance with certain provisions of Article 3 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement. However, the Panel concluded that investigating  authorities are not required by Article 11 to make any determination of injury  under Article 3, and the Ukrainian authorities did not make such a  determination. Therefore, the Panel rejected Russia's Article 11 claims which  it found to be dependent on a finding that the Ukrainian authorities made a  determination of injury under Article 3.</p>
            <p>Further, Russia claimed that  the Ukrainian authorities violated Article 5.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement  because they failed to exclude from the scope of the original anti-dumping  measures a Russian producer that was found to have a<em> de minimis</em> dumping margin in the original investigation phase, and  imposed a 0% anti-dumping duty on it instead. Russia also claimed that these  authorities violated Articles 5.8, 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement by including this producer in the scope of the review determination,  and then imposing anti-dumping duties against it following this determination.  Ukraine disputed Russia's assertion that this producer was found to have had a <em>de minimis </em>dumping margin in the  original investigation, contending that while the Ukrainian courts found no  dumping by this exporter, the investigating authorities themselves did not  calculate a <em>de minimis</em> dumping margin  for this producer in the original investigation. The Panel concluded that, as a  factual matter, this producer had a <em>de  minimis </em>margin in the original investigation phase, and on this basis  upheld Russia's claims under Article 5.8, while exercising judicial economy on  those under Articles 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3.</p>
            <p>Russia also raised procedural  claims under Articles 6.2 and 6.9, Article 6.8 and paragraphs 3, 5 and 6 of  Annex II, and Articles 12.2 and 12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. The Panel  upheld most of Russia's claims under Article 6.9 while rejecting one set of  claims under Articles 6.2 and 6.9. The Panel rejected Russia's claims under  Article 6.8 and paragraphs 3, 5 and 6 of Annex II, and found the claims under  Articles 12.2 and 12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement to be outside its terms  of reference. </p>
            <p>The Panel also rejected  Russia's claims under Articles 2.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article VI  of the GATT 1994, while exercising judicial economy on a number of other  claims. </p>

    	<p class="paranormaltext">On 23 August  2018, Ukraine notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body  certain issues of law and legal interpretations in the panel report.</p>
    	<p class="paranormaltext">On 22 October  2018, upon expiry of the 60-day period provided for in Article 17.5 of the DSU,  the Appellate Body informed the DSB that it would not be able to circulate the  Appellate Body report in this appeal by the end of the 60-day period, nor  within the 90-day time-frame provided for in Article 17.5 of the DSU. The  Appellate Body referred to the size of the panel record and the complexity of  issued that had been appealed. The Appellate Body also noted the backlog of  appeals pending with the Appellate Body at that time, and the overlap in the  composition of all divisions resulting in part from the reduced number of  Appellate Body members.The  Appellate Body informed the DSB that the Appellate Body would communicate  appropriately with participants and DSB Members as soon as it knew more  precisely when the Division can schedule the hearing in this appeal. On 31 July 2019,  the Chair of the Appellate Body notified the Chair of the DSB that the  Appellate Body Report in these proceedings would be circulated to WTO Members on  12 September 2019.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p><strong>Articles 6.2, 7.1, and 11 of the  DSU: the panel's terms of reference</strong></p>
            <p>The Appellate Body found that the  Panel did not err under Article 6.2 of the DSU in finding that certain decisions  by Ukrainian investigating authorities relating to the original investigation  phase (2008 amended decision and 2010 amendment) were identified as specific  measures at issue in Russia's panel request, and thus fell within the Panel's  terms of reference. The language in Russia's panel request, including express  references in footnotes, referred to the 2008 amended decision and the 2010  amendment and sufficiently linked those measures to Russia's claim under  Article 5.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.</p>
            <p>Further, the Appellate Body found  that the Panel did not err under Articles 7.1 and 11 of the DSU by ruling on  Russia's claim under Article 5.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement as it relates to  the 2008 amended decision and the 2010 amendment. The Appellate Body noted  that: (i)&nbsp;it had upheld the Panel's finding that the 2008 amended decision  and the 2010 amendment were identified as specific measures at issue in  Russia's panel request; (ii) Ukraine had not appealed the Panel's finding that  Russia had provided a brief summary of the legal basis for its claim under  Article 5.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement as it relates to those measures; and  (iii) Ukraine had not advanced other grounds in support of its challenge under  Articles 7.1 and 11 of the DSU.</p>
            <p><strong>Article 11 of the DSU: objective  assessment of the matter</strong></p>
            <p>The Appellate Body found that the  Panel had objectively assessed the matter before it in accordance with Article  11 of the DSU. It therefore upheld the Panel's findings that Ukraine acted  inconsistently with Article 5.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement in relation to  the 2008 amended decision, the 2010 amendment, and the decision following  subsequent interim and expiry reviews (2014 extension decision). The Appellate  Body considered that the Panel had provided a reasoned and coherent explanation  in concluding that the combined effect of Ukrainian court judgments and their  implementation by the 2010 amendment was that the dumping margin for EuroChem  in the original investigation phase was <em>de  minimis</em>. This in turn triggered Ukraine's obligation under Article 5.8 to  exclude EuroChem from the scope of the anti-dumping investigation.  Notwithstanding Ukraine's arguments about the authority of Ukrainian courts and  investigating authorities to calculate dumping margins under Ukrainian law, the  effect of the Panel's reasoning was that the Ukrainian court judgments, as  implemented by Ukrainian investigating authorities, invalidated the basis at  that point for imposing a dumping margin on EuroChem. </p>
            <p>Article 2.2.1.1 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement: whether records reasonably reflect the costs associated with the  production and sale of the product under consideration</p>
    	    <p>The first sentence of  Article&nbsp;2.2.1.1 directs the investigating authority normally to base its  calculations of costs on the records of the exporter or producer under  investigation, provided that such records are in  accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting  country (first condition), and that they &ldquo;reasonably reflect the  costs associated with the production and sale of the product under  consideration&rdquo; (second condition). Given the reference to  &ldquo;normally&rdquo;, the Appellate&nbsp;Body did not exclude that there might  be circumstances other than those in these two conditions in which the  obligation to base the calculation of costs on the records does not apply.  However, the Appellate Body did not consider it necessary to resolve the dispute  to consider further whether such circumstances existed and what they might be.  With respect to the second condition, the Appellate Body considered that it is  the &ldquo;records&rdquo; of the individual exporter or producer under  investigation that are subject to the condition to &ldquo;reasonably  reflect&rdquo; the &ldquo;costs associated with the production and sale of the  product under consideration&rdquo;. There is no standard of reasonableness that  governs the meaning of &ldquo;costs&rdquo; itself, which would allow  investigating authorities to disregard domestic input prices when such prices  are lower than other prices internationally.</p>
            <p>The Appellate Body upheld the  Panel's finding that Ukraine acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;2.2.1.1  because Ukrainian investigating authorities did not provide an adequate basis  under the second condition in the first sentence of that provision to reject  the price of gas that the Russian  producers under investigation paid and reported in their records (reported  gas cost). Ukrainian investigating authorities had examined whether, due to  government regulation, the gas costs incurred by the investigated Russian  producers were lower compared with prices in other countries or other export  prices of gas from Russia. The Appellate Body agreed with the Panel that this  examination pertained to whether the cost of gas incurred by these producers  was reasonable and was thus not an adequate reason to reject the reported gas  cost. Ukrainian investigating authorities had also taken the view that Gazprom  sells gas in the domestic Russian market below cost, but made no determination  that Gazprom was the gas supplier of the investigated Russian producers or that  Gazprom's prices affected these suppliers' prices. The Appellate Body therefore  agreed with the Panel that Gazprom's below&#8209;cost prices did not constitute a  sufficient factual basis to conclude that the records of the investigated  Russian producers did not reasonably reflect the costs associated with the  production and sale of ammonium nitrate.<u></u></p>
            <p><strong>Article 2.2.1 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement: ordinary-course-of-trade test </strong></p>
            <p>The Appellate Body observed  that Article 2.2.1 sets out when sales of the like product in the domestic  market or to a third country may be treated as not being in the ordinary course  of trade and disregarded in determining normal value. The Appellate Body noted  that Ukraine's claim under Article 2.2.1 was consequential to its claim under  Article 2.2.1.1. Having upheld the Panel's finding under Article 2.2.1.1 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement, the Appellate Body also upheld the Panel's finding that  Ukraine acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;2.2.1 because, in conducting its  ordinary-course-of-trade test, Ukrainian investigating authorities relied on  costs calculated inconsistently with Article&nbsp;2.2.1.1.</p>
            <p><strong>Article 2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement: cost of production &ldquo;in  the country of origin&rdquo;</strong></p>
            <p>The Appellate Body upheld the  Panel's finding under Article 2.2 that, by using the export price of gas from  Russia at the German border adapted for transportation expenses for the purpose  of constructing normal value, Ukrainian investigating authorities failed to  calculate the cost of production &ldquo;in the country of origin&rdquo;, i.e.  Russia. The Appellate Body recalled that Article 2.2 identifies circumstances  in which an investigating authority need not determine normal value on the  basis of domestic sales and may instead construct normal value on the basis of  &ldquo;the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount  for administrative, selling and general costs and for profits&rdquo;. When  constructing normal value, an investigating authority must ensure that the  information collected is used to arrive at the cost of production in the  country of origin. An investigating authority may thus be required to adapt the  information it collects.</p>
Ukraine  had first argued that it would be circular and void of economic logic to  calculate the cost of production under Article&nbsp;2.2 on the basis of costs  adequately rejected under the second condition in the first sentence of  Article&nbsp;2.2.1.1. The Appellate Body considered this argument to be  premised on finding error with the Panel under Article 2.2.1.1 and recalled  that it had upheld the Panel's finding under that provision. Moreover, the  Appellate Body considered that the Panel did not err in considering that certain  Appellate&nbsp;Body interpretations with respect to Article&nbsp;14(d) of the  SCM Agreement were not relevant to its interpretative exercise under Article  2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.Finally,  the Appellate Body saw no reason to question the Panel's conclusion that  adjusting for transportation expenses was not sufficient to adapt the export  price of gas from Russia to reflect the cost of production in Russia. As the  Appellate Body stressed, the Panel found that Ukrainian investigating  authorities had not explained why such an adjustment was adequate to adapt the  export price of gas to reflect the cost in the country of origin. The Appellate  Body and the Panel also recalled that Ukrainian investigating authorities did  not provide an adequate basis under the second condition in the first sentence  of Article 2.2.1.1 to reject the reported gas cost. The Appellate Body further  noted that, other than pointing to the deduction of transportation expenses,  Ukraine had not asserted that Ukrainian investigating authorities otherwise  adapted the export price of gas used in its calculations in order to ensure  that it reflected the cost of production in Russia.
