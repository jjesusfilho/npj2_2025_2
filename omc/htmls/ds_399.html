        <h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by China.&nbsp;  </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 14 September 2009, China requested consultations  with the United States concerning increased tariffs on certain passenger  vehicle and light truck tyres (subject tyres) from  China.&nbsp; The decision was  announced  on 11&nbsp;September 2009 following an investigation pursuant to section 421 of  the Trade Act of 1974 (19&nbsp;U.S.C. 2451 <em>et  seq.</em>).&nbsp; The USITC determined that there was market  disruption as a result of rapidly increasing imports of subject tyres from  China that were a significant cause of material injury to the domestic  industry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Following a Presidential  decision additional duties were imposed on subject tyres imports for a  three year period in the amount of 35 per cent <em>ad valorem </em>in the first year,  30 per cent <em>ad valorem </em>in the second year and&nbsp; 25 per cent <em>ad valorem </em>in the third year  (the <em>tyres</em> measure). This measure  took  effect on 26 September  2009.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> According to China the higher tariffs are inconsistent  with Article I:1 of the GATT 1994 and  have not been properly justified pursuant to Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and  the Agreement on Safeguards.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> China also maintains  that these measures are not properly justified as China-specific restrictions  under paragraph&nbsp;16  of its  Protocolof Accession. &nbsp;Specifically, China alleges that the US  statute defines &ldquo;significant cause&rdquo; more narrowly than required by  the ordinary meaning of that phrase as used in  paragraph&nbsp;16.4  of the  Protocol of Accession.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> China also alleges that these measures are also  inconsistent, as applied, with the United&nbsp;States' obligations under China's   Protocol of Accession<em>, </em>specifically:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li> paragraphs 16.1  and 16.4 because (a) imports from China were not &ldquo;in such increased  quantities&rdquo; and were not &ldquo;increasing rapidly&rdquo;; (b) imports from  China were not a &ldquo;significant cause&rdquo; of material injury or threat  thereof; and (c) the domestic tyre producers were not experiencing &ldquo;market  disruption&rdquo; or &ldquo;material injury&rdquo;;<br>
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li> paragraph 16.3  because the restrictions are being imposed beyond the &ldquo;extent necessary to  prevent or remedy&rdquo; any alleged market disruption; and <br>
&nbsp;        </li>
        <li> paragraph 16.6  because the restrictions are being imposed for a period of time longer than  &ldquo;necessary to prevent or remedy&rdquo; any alleged market disruption.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 9 December 2009, China requested the establishment  of a panel.&nbsp; At its meeting on 21  December 2009, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.    </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 19 January 2010, the DSB established  a panel  pursuant to the request from China.&nbsp; The European Union, Japan, Chinese Taipei,  Turkey and Viet Nam reserved their third-party rights.&nbsp; On 2 March 2010, China requested the  Director-General to determine the composition of the panel.&nbsp; On 12 March 2010, the Director-General  composed the panel.&nbsp; On 31 May 2010, the  Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that the panel would   not be able to complete its work in six months in light of scheduling  conflicts.&nbsp; The panel expected   to complete its work in November 2010. </p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 8 November 2010, the final report was issued to  the parties. &nbsp;On 13 December  2010, the panel report was circulated to Members.&nbsp; China made seven specific claims in this dispute  based on paragraph 16 of the  Protocol, and GATT 1994.&nbsp;  In respect of the Protocol, China asked the panel to find that:</p>
        <ol type="i" class="paranormaltext">
          <li>the United  States failed to evaluate properly whether imports from China were in  &ldquo;such increased quantities&rdquo; and &ldquo;increasing rapidly&rdquo; as  required by paragraphs 16.1 and 16.4  of the Protocol; <br>
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>the US statute implementing  the causation standard of paragraph 16 into US law was  inconsistent &ldquo;as such&rdquo; with paragraphs 16.1 and 16.4  of the Protocol;<br>
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>the United States failed to  evaluate properly whether imports from China were a &ldquo;significant  cause&rdquo; as required by paragraphs 16.1 and 16.4  of the Protocol;<br>
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>the United  States imposed a transitional safeguard  measure that went beyond the &ldquo;extent necessary&rdquo;, and thus it was  inconsistent with paragraph 16.3 of the  Protocol;<br>
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>the United  States imposed a transitional safeguard measure for a three-year period that  went beyond &ldquo;such period of time&rdquo; that was &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;, and  thus it was inconsistent with paragraph 16.6 of the  Protocol.&nbsp; </li>
        </ol>
          <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Regarding China's claims under GATT 1994, China  asked the panel to find that:</strong></p>
<ol type="i" class="paranormaltext"><li>the  transitional safeguard measure was  inconsistent with Article I:1 of the GATT 1994 as the United States did not  accord the same treatment that it grants to passenger vehicle and light truck  tyres originating in other countries to like products originating in China;<br>
&nbsp;</li>

                <li>the transitional safeguard  measure is inconsistent with Article II:1(b) of the GATT 1994 as  the tariffs consist of unjustified modifications of US concessions  on passenger vehicle and light truck tyres under the GATT 1994.</li>
      </ol>
            <p class="paranormaltext">China asked that the panel recommend  that the United States promptly comply with its obligations and withdraw the <em>tyres</em> measure.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The United States asked the panel to reject  China's claims in their entirety.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="paranormaltext"><strong>The  relationship between paragraphs 16.1 and  paragraph 16.4 of the Protocol</strong></p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">China argued that the phrase &ldquo;in such  increased quantities&rdquo; in paragraph 16.1 of the Protocol, which also appears  in Article 2.1 of the Agreement on Safeguards<em>, </em>was a base level requirement in addressing  increasing imports under the Protocol.&nbsp;  In accordance with case law under the Agreement on  Safeguards<em>, </em>China argued that imports, as a first step, needed  to be sudden enough, sharp enough, and significant enough to cause injury. Only  after that first step had been achieved would the focus then shift to paragraph 16.4 of the  Protocol where imports would also need to meet the requirement of  &ldquo;increasing rapidly&rdquo;. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The panel rejected this approach.&nbsp; The panel found that paragraph 16.4  clarified the substance of the conditions for taking action under paragraph 16 of the  Protocol &mdash; i.e. that imports had to be &ldquo;increasing  rapidly&rdquo; and that there had to be &ldquo;a significant cause&rdquo; of  material injury to the domestic industry.&nbsp;  Therefore, in this regard the panel's findings  focused on paragraph 16.4 of the  Protocol rather than paragraph 16.1.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Panel's findings and conclusions</strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Essentially, China's claims focused on five issues:</p>
<ol type="i" class="paranormaltext">
<li>China argued  that despite the absolute increases in subject imports, a decline in the rate  of increase in the final year of the period of investigation (2008) meant that  subject imports were not &ldquo;increasing rapidly&rdquo; in accordance with paragraph 16.4 of the  Protocol.&nbsp; The panel disagreed and  found that subject imports were increasing rapidly, both absolutely and  relatively, in accordance with the Protocol.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li> China asserted  that the United States' &ldquo;contributes significantly&rdquo; definition in its  statute was at odds with the ordinary meaning of the &ldquo;significant  cause&rdquo; standard in paragraph 16.4 of the  Protocol.&nbsp; The panel rejected this  &ldquo;as such&rdquo; argument.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li> China claimed  that the USITC failed to properly demonstrate that subject imports were a  &ldquo;significant cause&rdquo; of market disruption.&nbsp; China's claim was based on three principal  arguments: (1) a failure by the USITC to show conditions of competition between  subject imports and the domestic product to support a finding of causation; (2)  a failure by the USITC to establish any temporal correlation between rapidly  increasing subject imports and material injury to the domestic industry; and  (3) a failure by the USITC to address alternative causes of material injury to  the domestic industry.&nbsp; The panel rejected all  of China's arguments.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>China claimed  that the remedy applied in this case was inconsistent with paragraph 16.3 of the  Protocol as it was not limited to the market disruption caused by rapidly  increasing imports; and that, contrary to paragraph 16.6, the  three year duration exceeded the period of time necessary to prevent or remedy  the market disruption.&nbsp; The panel found that  China had failed to establish a prima facie case in relation to both of these  remedy claims.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li> The panel found that  China's claims under GATT 1994 were dependent on its claims under paragraph 16 of the  Protocol.&nbsp; They were, therefore,  similarly unsuccessful.</li>
</ol>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The panel concluded that in imposing the transitional  safeguards measure on 26 September 2009 in respect of imports of subject tyres  from China, the United States did not fail to comply with its obligations under  paragraph 16 of the  Protocol and Articles I:1 and II:1 of the GATT 1994.&nbsp; The panel also found  that there was no &ldquo;as such&rdquo; violation in respect of the US statute  implementing the causation standard of paragraph 16 of the  Protocol.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">On 27  January 2011, China and the United States requested the DSB to adopt a draft decision  extending the 60-day time period stipulated in Article 16.4 of the DSU, to 24&nbsp;May  2011.&nbsp; At its meeting on 7 February 2011,  the DSB agreed that, upon a request by China and the United&nbsp;States, the  DSB, shall no later than 24 May 2011, adopt the panel report, unless the DSB  decides by consensus not to do so or China or the United States notifies the  DSB of its decision to appeal pursuant to Article 16.4 of the DSU.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">On 24 May 2011, China notified the DSB of its  decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of  law and legal interpretation covered in the panel report. On 22 July 2011, the Chair of the Appellate Body  informed the DSB that due to the time required for completion of its report,  the Appellate Body would not be able to circulate its report within 60 days. &nbsp;The Appellate Body estimated that the report  will be circulated no later than 5 September 2011.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><a name="bkmk399abr" id="bkmk399abr"></a>On 5  September 2011, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p class="paranormaltext">China appealed aspects of the Panel's finding that, in imposing the  safeguard measure in respect of imports of certain passenger vehicle and light truck tyres from China, the  United States did not act inconsistently with its obligations under Section 16  of China's Accession Protocol.&nbsp; Under  Section 16 of the Protocol, other WTO Members have the right to impose  safeguard measures on imports from China alone when such imports are  &ldquo;increasing rapidly&rdquo; so as to be a &ldquo;significant cause&rdquo; of  material injury to the domestic industry.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body <strong>upheld</strong> the Panel's finding that the USITC did not fail to properly evaluate whether  imports from China met the specific threshold under Paragraph 16.4 of China's  Accession Protocol of &ldquo;increasing rapidly&rdquo;.&nbsp; The Appellate found that Paragraph 16.4  requires investigating authorities to assess import trends over a sufficiently  recent period, and to determine whether imports are increasing significantly,  either in absolute or relative terms, within a short period of time.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> With respect to the particular causation standard set out under  Paragraph 16.4 of China's Accession Protocol, the Appellate Body <strong>found</strong> that the term &ldquo;a significant  cause&rdquo; in Paragraph 16.4 of the Protocol requires that rapidly increasing  imports make an &ldquo;important&rdquo; or &ldquo;notable&rdquo; contribution in  bringing about material injury to the domestic industry.&nbsp; The Appellate Body explained that an  investigating authority can make a determination as to whether subject imports  are a &ldquo;significant&rdquo; cause of material injury only if it ensures that  effects of other known causes are not improperly attributed to subject imports.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> Turning to China's specific claims of error in relation to the Panel's  review of the USITC's causation analysis, the Appellate Body <strong>upheld</strong> the Panel's finding that the  USITC did not err in its assessment of the conditions of competition in the overall  US tyres market.&nbsp; The Appellate Body  further <strong>upheld</strong> the Panel's finding  that the USITC's reliance on overall coincidence between an upward movement in  imports from China and a downward movement in injury factors supported the  USITC's finding that rapidly increasing imports from China were a significant  cause of material injury to the domestic industry.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body also <strong>upheld</strong> the Panel's finding that China failed to establish that the USITC improperly  attributed injury caused by other factors to imports from China.&nbsp; The Appellate Body found that the Panel did  not err in its review of the USITC's analysis of the US industry's business  strategy and the reasons for certain US plant closures; &nbsp;did not err in concluding that the USITC  properly found that imports from China had injurious effects independent of  changes in demand; &nbsp;and did not  improperly attribute to Chinese imports the effects of imports from third  countries.&nbsp; The Appellate Body said it considered  the Panel's analysis to have been sufficient particularly given that, under  Paragraph 16.4 of the Protocol, rapidly increasing imports from China may be  one of several causes that contribute to producing or bringing about material  injury to the domestic industry.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> Finally, the Appellate Body found that the Panel did not act  inconsistently with Article 11 of the DSU in its review of the USITC's  causation analysis. </p></div>
</div>    
</div>
</div>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 5 October 2011, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the panel report, as upheld by the Appellate Body report.</p>
