        <h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Japan. (See also <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds426_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS426</a>) </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 13  September 2010, Japan requested consultations with Canada regarding Canada's  measures relating to domestic content requirements in the feed-in tariff  program (the &ldquo;FIT Program&rdquo;).</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">Japan claimed  that the measures are inconsistent with Canada's obligations under Article  III:4 and III:5 of the GATT 1994 because they appear to be laws, regulations or requirements affecting the internal sale,  offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution, or use of equipment for  renewable energy generation facilities that accord less favorable treatment to imported equipment than that accorded to  like products originating in Ontario; that the measures  could be internal  quantitative regulations relating to the mixture, processing or use of a specified amount or proportion  of equipment for renewable energy generation  facilities which require that equipment for renewable energy generation  facilities be  supplied from Ontario sources; and that the measures appear to require the mixture, processing or use  of equipment for renewable energy generation  facilities supplied from Ontario in specified amounts or proportions, being applied so as to afford  protection to Ontario production of such equipment, contrary to the principles  of Article III:1 of the GATT 1994.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">Japan also  claimed that the measures appear to be inconsistent with Article 2.1 of the TRIMs  Agreement because they appear to be trade-related investment measures that are inconsistent with the  provisions of Article III of the GATT 1994.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Finally, Japan alleged that it appears  that a subsidy is granted  under the measures  because there would be a financial contribution or a form of income or  price support, and a benefit is thereby conferred.&nbsp; It is also claimed that the subsidy would be a prohibited subsidy under Articles 3.1(b) and 3.2 of the  SCM Agreement because it appears to be provided &ldquo;contingent &hellip; upon the use of  domestic over imported goods&rdquo;, namely contingent upon the use of equipment for  renewable energy generation facilities produced in Ontario over such equipment imported  from countries such as Japan.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 24  September 2010, the United States requested to join the consultations.&nbsp; On 27 September 2010, the European Union  requested to join the consultations.&nbsp;  Subsequently, Canada informed the DSB that it had accepted the requests  of the European Union and the United States to join the consultations.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 1 June 2011, Japan requested the establishment  of a panel.&nbsp; At its meeting on 17 June  2011, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 20 July 2011, the DSB established  a panel.&nbsp; Australia, China, the European  Union, Honduras, Korea, Norway, Chinese Taipei and the United States reserved  their third-party rights.&nbsp; Subsequently,   Brazil, El Salvador, India,  Mexico and Saudi Arabia reserved their  third-party rights. On 26 September 2011, Japan requested the  Director-General to determine the composition of the panel.&nbsp; On 6 October 2011, the Director-General  composed the panel. </p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 2 March 2012, the Chairman of the panel  informed the DSB that the panel would not be able to issue its report within  six months.&nbsp; The timetable adopted by the  panel after consultations with the parties envisaged that the final report  would be issued to the parties by September 2012.&nbsp; The panel expected to conclude its work  within that time-frame.&nbsp; On 13 June 2012,  the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB that due to the complexities of the  dispute, it would not be possible for the panel to complete its work within the  time-frame mentioned above. &nbsp;The panel now  expects to complete its work by the end of November 2012.</p>

                      <ul class="paranormaltext">
                        <li>The dispute concerns the domestic content  requirements that certain generators of  electricity utilizing solar photovoltaic and windpower technology must comply  with in the design and construction of electricity generation facilities in  order to qualify for guaranteed prices offered under the Feed-In Tariff  (&ldquo;FIT&rdquo;) Programme, adopted by the Government of the Province of  Ontario, as well as all individual FIT and microFIT Contracts implementing  these requirements since the FIT Programme's inception in 2009 (&ldquo;the  challenged measures&rdquo;).<br />
&nbsp;                        </li>
                        <li>Japan claimed that the domestic content  requirements provided for and implemented under the challenged measures place  Canada in violation of: (i) the national treatment obligation under Article  III:4 of the GATT 1994; (ii) the prohibition that is set out in Article 2.1 of  the TRIMs Agreement on the application of any trade-related investment measures  that are inconsistent with Article III of the GATT 1994; and (iii) the  prohibition on import substitution subsidies prescribed in Articles 3.1(b) and  3.2 of the SCM Agreement.<br />
&nbsp;                        </li>
                        <li>The Panel upheld Japan's claims under  Article&nbsp;2.1 of the TRIMs&nbsp;Agreement and Article&nbsp;III:4 of the  GATT&nbsp;1994. After noting that the trade-related investment measures  described in paragraph 1(a) of the Illustrative List found in the Annex to the  TRIMs Agreement are considered to be inconsistent with Article 2.1 of the TRIMs  Agreement and Article III:4 of the GATT 1994, subject to the operation of <em>inter alia</em> Article III:8(a) of the GATT  1994, the Panel set about determining: (i) whether Canada could rely upon Article III:8(a) of the GATT  1994 to remove the challenged measures from the operation of Article 2.1 of the  TRIMs Agreement; and if not, (ii) whether the challenged measures were of the  kind described in paragraph 1(a) of the Illustrative List.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;                        </li>
                        <li>The Panel found that Canada had not established it was entitled to rely  upon Article III:8(a) of the GATT 1994 because the Government of  Ontario's procurement of electricity under the FIT Programme was undertaken  &ldquo;with a view to commercial resale&rdquo;. The Panel furthermore found that  the challenged measures fell within the scope of paragraph 1(a) of the  Illustrative List.&nbsp; The Panel thereby  concluded that Japan had demonstrated that the challenged measures were  inconsistent with Canada's obligations under Article 2.1 of the TRIMs Agreement  and Article III:4 of the GATT 1994.<br />
&nbsp;                        </li>
                        <li>As regards Japan's prohibited subsidy claims  under Articles&nbsp;3.1(b) and 3.2 of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement, the Panel delivered  a divided ruling. <br />
&nbsp;                        </li>
                        <li>The Panel majority dismissed Japan's allegations  on the grounds that Japan had failed to establish the existence of a subsidy. Among  the Panel majority's key findings in support of this assessment was that the  Hourly Ontario Electricity Price (&ldquo;HOEP&rdquo;) that was at the centre of  Japan's main benefit arguments could not serve as an appropriate benchmark  against which to determine whether the challenged measures confered a &ldquo;benefit&rdquo;  within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement, because: (i) the  HOEP did not result from the operation of a <strong>competitive</strong> wholesale electricity market, but rather a market that was significantly  influenced by government regulation; (ii) the economics of <strong>competitive</strong> wholesale electricity markets in general suggest that  they will <strong>rarely</strong> attract the degree  of investment in generation capacity needed to secure a reliable electricity  system; and (iii) the <strong>prevailing  conditions of supply and demand in Ontario</strong> suggest that a competitive  wholesale electricity market would fail to achieve this outcome in Ontario.  Thus, the Panel majority concluded that there was no basis to uphold Japan's  subsidization arguments.<br />
&nbsp;                        </li>
                        <li>After having rejected Japan's arguments, and in  response to Japan's specific requests, the Panel majority set out its own <em>observations</em> on one approach it  considered could have been validly pursued in these disputes to determine the  existence of &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; under the terms of Article&nbsp;1.1(b) of the  SCM&nbsp;Agreement.&nbsp; The Panel majority  described the approach it contemplated as one that would involve making a  comparison between the relevant rates of return of the challenged FIT and  microFIT Contracts with the average cost of capital in Canada for projects  having a comparable risk profile to the FIT and microFIT projects. The Panel  majority went on to explain that, while this comparison would have been useful  for the &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; analysis, it would have been necessary to explore a  number of important questions and factual issues in order to apply it.<br />
&nbsp;                        </li>
                        <li>Finally, one member of the Panel expressed a dissenting  opinion on Japan's subsidization claims, finding that Japan had demonstrated  that the challenged measures conferred a &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; under the terms of  Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement.&nbsp; For  this member of the Panel, the challenged measures were subsidies because the  pricing offered to relatively high cost and less efficient FIT and microFIT  generators under the FIT and microFIT Contracts enabled them to enter the  wholesale electricity market, when they would otherwise not have been able to  in the absence of the FIT Programme implemented by the Government of the  Province of Ontario.</li>

<p class="paranormaltext">On 5 February 2013, Canada notified the DSB of its  decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the  panel report and certain legal interpretations developed by the panel.&nbsp; On 11 February 2013, Japan notified the DSB  of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered  in the panel report and certain legal interpretations developed by the panel.

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p class="paranormaltext">Canada filed a Notice  of Appeal on 5 February 2013. Japan filed an other appeal on 11 February 2013.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The measures at issue in this dispute are the FIT Programme  implemented by the Government of Ontario and related FIT and microFIT  Contracts. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body <strong>declined</strong> Japan's request to  commence its evaluation with Japan's allegations of error relating to the SCM  Agreement.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">As  regards Canada's and Japan's appeals concerning Article&nbsp;III:8(a) of the  GATT 1994, the Appellate Body <strong>reversed</strong> the Panel's finding that the Minimum Required  Domestic Content Levels of the FIT&nbsp;Programme and FIT and microFIT  Contracts are laws, regulations, or requirements governing the procurement by  governmental agencies of electricity within the meaning of Article&nbsp;III:8(a)  of the GATT&nbsp;1994. The Appellate Body also declared moot and of no legal  effect certain other intermediate findings made by the Panel. Moreover, the  Appellate Body <strong>found</strong> that the Minimum Required Domestic Content Levels  prescribed under the FIT&nbsp;Programme and related FIT and microFIT Contracts  do not meet the conditions of the derogation in Article&nbsp;III:8(a) of the  GATT 1994. It thus <strong>found</strong> that the challenged measures are not covered by  Article&nbsp;III:8(a) of the GATT 1994 and that, consequently, the Panel's that  the Minimum Required Domestic Content Levels prescribed under the  FIT&nbsp;Programme and related FIT and microFIT Contracts are inconsistent with  Article&nbsp;2.1 of the TRIMS Agreement and Article&nbsp;III:4 of the  GATT&nbsp;1994, <strong>stands</strong>. In the light of its findings, the Appellate Body  did not consider it necessary to address Canada's claim that the Panel failed  to fulfil its obligations under Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU in concluding that  the Government of Ontario purchases electricity under the FIT Programme  &ldquo;with a view to commercial resale&rdquo;.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body additionally <strong>rejected</strong> Japan's claim that the Panel failed to fulfil its obligations under  Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU and exercised false judicial economy by declining to  make a finding on Japan's claim that the Minimum Required Domestic Content  Levels are inconsistent with Article&nbsp;III:4 of the GATT 1994 independently of  the TRIMs Agreement.
            </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">With respect to Japan's appeal relating to Article&nbsp;1.1(a)  of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement, the Appellate Body <strong>upheld</strong> the Panel's finding  that the FIT&nbsp;Programme and related FIT&nbsp;and microFIT Contracts are  government &ldquo;purchases [of] goods&rdquo; within the meaning of  Article&nbsp;1.1(a)(1)(iii) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement. Furthermore the  Appellate Body <strong>rejected</strong> Japan's appeal that the challenged measures may  also be characterized as &ldquo;direct transfer[s] of funds&rdquo; or  &ldquo;potential direct transfers of funds&rdquo; under Article&nbsp;1.1(a)(1)(i)  of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement, as well as Japan's claim that the Panel failed to  fulfil its obligations under Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU and exercised false judicial  economy by declining to make a finding on Japan's claim that the measures at  issue constitute &ldquo;income or price support&rdquo; under  Article&nbsp;1.1(a)(2) of the SCM Agreement. The Appellate Body itself <strong>declined</strong> to make such a finding. The Appellate Body declared moot and of no legal effect  the Panel's finding that &ldquo;government &lsquo;purchases [of] goods&rsquo; could [not]  also be legally characterized as &lsquo;direct transfer[s] of funds&rsquo; without  infringing [the] principle [of effective treaty interpretation]&rdquo;, inasmuch  as it negates the possibility that a transaction may fall under more than one  type of financial contribution under Article&nbsp;1.1(a)(1) of the SCM  Agreement.</p>
            <span class="paranormaltext">As regards Japan's  appeal relating to Article&nbsp;1.1(b) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement, the Appellate  Body <strong>reversed</strong> the Panel's finding that Japan failed to establish that  the FIT&nbsp;Programme and related FIT and microFIT Contracts confer a benefit  within the meaning of Article&nbsp;1.1(b) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement,  because the Panel erred in defining the relevant market and in its benefit  analysis. In the light of these findings, the Appellate Body did not find it  necessary to address Japan's alternative claim that the Panel acted  inconsistently with Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU. The Appellate Body was unable  to complete the analysis as to whether the challenged measures confer a benefit  within the meaning of Article&nbsp;1.1(b) of the SCM&nbsp;Agreement  and whether Canada acted inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1(b) and 3.2 of  the SCM Agreement. 
            </span>            <p class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body <strong>recommended</strong> that the DSB request Canada to bring its measures found in  the Appellate Body Report, and in the Panel Report as modified by the Appellate  Body Report, to be inconsistent with the TRIMs&nbsp;Agreement and the GATT 1994 into conformity with its obligations  under those Agreements.</p>

<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 24 May 2013, the DSB adopted the  Appellate Body report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body  report.</p>

<h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 20 June 2013, Canada informed the DSB that it  intended to implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings in a  manner that respects its WTO obligations and that it will  require a reasonable period of time to do so. On 29 July 2013, Canada and Japan informed the DSB  that they had agreed that the reasonable period of time to implement the DSB'  recommendations and rulings shall be 10 months.&nbsp;  Accordingly, the reasonable period of time expired on 24 March 2014. On 24 March 2014, Japan and Canada informed the DSB  that they had mutually agreed to modify the reasonable  period of time to expire on 5 June 2014.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 5 June 2014, Canada informed the DSB that the  Government of Ontario had complied with the DSB recommendations and rulings by  (i) no longer subjecting large renewable electricity procurements to domestic  requirements; and (ii) significantly lowering the domestic content  requirements for small and microFIT procurement of wind and solar electricity  under the FIT Program. At the DSB meeting on  18 June 2014, the European Union and Japan were  surprised and concerned that Canada had not submitted a status report on this  dispute and DS426, and would inscribe this item on the agenda of the next DSB  meeting.</p>

<h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 24 March 2014, Japan  and Canada informed the DSB of Agreed Procedures under  Articles 21 and 22 of the DSU.</p>
