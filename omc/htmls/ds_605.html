         <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Costa Rica</strong></p>
        <p align="left">On 23 July 2021, Costa Rica requested consultations  with the Dominican Republic with respect to antidumping measures imposed on the  importation of corrugated or deformed steel bars or rods for the reinforcement  of concrete originating in Costa Rica.</p>
        <p align="left"> Costa Rica claimed that the measures at issue  appear to be inconsistent with: </p>

        <h3>Panel  and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
         <p>
        On 15 November  2021, Costa Rica requested the  establishment of a panel.  At its meeting on 29 November 2021, the DSB deferred the establishment of the panel. </p>
         <p> At its meeting  on 20 December 2021, the DSB established a panel. Canada,  China, the European Union, India, Japan, Mexico,  the Russian Federation, and the United States reserved their  third-party rights.</p>
<p align="left">On 28 March  2022, Costa Rica requested the  Director-General to compose the panel. On 8  April 2022, the  Director-General composed the panel.</p>
<p align="left">On 7 October 2022,  the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that in view of the Working  Procedures and the Timetable that were prepared in consultation with the  parties, and due to the  complexity of the case and the parties' requests for additional time to prepare  their submissions, the panel did not  expect to issue its final report to the parties before the first quarter of  2023. The Chair apprised the DSB that the report would be available to the  public once it was circulated to the Members in all three official languages,  and that the date of circulation depends on completion of translation. On 7 February 2023, the  Chair of the panel informed the DSB that the panel expected to issue its final  report to the parties by the end of the second quarter of 2023.</p>

    	    <p>This dispute concerned a  challenge to the Dominican Republic's imposition of anti-dumping duties on imports of corrugated or deformed  steel bars or rods for concrete or concrete reinforcement from Costa Rica.  Costa Rica challenged the determination of the existence of dumping and the  calculation of the margin of dumping by the Dominican Republic's anti-dumping  investigating authority, La Comisi&oacute;n Reguladora de Pr&aacute;cticas Desleales en el  Comercio y sobre Medidas de Salvaguardias (CDC). Costa Rica additionally  challenged the CDC's injury determination regarding dumped imports from Costa  Rica as well as various procedural aspects of the investigation. </p>
            <p><strong>Claims  related to the CDC's calculation of the dumping margin</strong></p>
            <p>
              The Panel  upheld several claims raised by Costa Rica concerning aspects of the CDC's determination of the existence of dumping and  the calculation of the margin of dumping: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The  first issue concerned the date of sales taken into account for the calculation  of the dumping margin: certain sales used by the CDC for the calculation of the  export price had been invoiced prior to the start of the period of  investigation, while sales used for the calculation of normal value had all  been invoiced within the boundaries of the period of investigation. The Panel  concluded that this reliance on sales made in periods spanning different  timeframes did not comply with the obligation of the second sentence of Article  2.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement to make the comparison between the export  price and the normal value &ldquo;in respect of sales made at as nearly as  possible the same time&rdquo;.</li>
              <li>The  second issue concerned sales which had been identified by the CDC as sales  below costs, which had thus been eliminated from the calculation of the normal  value. The Panel considered that an investigating authority is required to use  a methodology that allows it to reasonably identify sales that are above cost  &ldquo;at the time of sale&rdquo; so as not to distort the analysis of whether  the transactions are below costs. The Panel found that the CDC had failed to  consider the possibility of distortion in its analysis based on the use of the  annual weighted average of the investigation period, despite being aware that  production costs had increased significantly during the POI, and thus acted  inconsistently with the second sentence of Article 2.2.1 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Claims  related to the CDC's determination of threat of material injury and the causal  link between imports and injury:</strong></p>
            <p>
              The Panel  upheld various claims made by Costa Rica under Articles 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5 and  3.7 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, in relation to the CDC's determination that  imports from Costa Rica were causing a threat of material injury to its  domestic industry:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Regarding  the CDC's examination of price effects, the Panel agreed with Costa Rica  that the CDC's analysis of price depression was not objective, and thus  inconsistent with Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, as the CDC  did not consider the evolution of prices throughout the 2016-2018 period of  investigation, or the fact that the average price calculated at the end of the  POI returned to almost the same level as 2015. The Panel, however, disagreed  with Costa Rica that the CDC had failed to properly consider whether there had  been significant price undercutting or significant price suppression.</li>
              <li>Regarding the CDC's examination of the impact of  imports on the domestic industry, the Panel agreed with Costa Rica that the CDC  was required to examine the factors and indices mentioned in Article 3.4 of the  Antidumping Agreement in order to establish a background against which it can  evaluate whether imminent further dumped imports would affect the industry's  condition. The Panel analysed each of the elements of Costa Rica's claims,  concluding that the CDC's analyses of profitability, cash flow, employment and  market share loss were not objective or supported by evidence on record, and  additionally found that the CDC's isolated analysis of certain negative  domestic industry indicators was incompatible with the requirements of Articles  3.1 and 3.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.</li>
              <li>The Panel upheld Costa Rica's claim that the  CDC's analysis of threat of material injury was inconsistent with Articles 3.1  and 3.7 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. The Panel found that the CDC's analysis  of projections on the likelihood of substantially increased dumped imports, and  its analysis  of whether imports were entering at prices that would have a significant  depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, were not based on  the facts on the record of the investigation, and thus, the CDC's conclusion  that alleged dumped imports would cause injury that is &ldquo;clearly foreseeable  and imminent&rdquo; was unsubstantiated.</li>
              <li>Finally, the Panel upheld Costa Rica's claim under Articles 3.1 and 3.5 of  the Anti-Dumping Agreement regarding the CDC's analysis of causation, on the  basis that, in totality, the CDC had failed to assess the issue of whether  future injury could be caused by the dumped Costa Rican imports. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Claim  related to the CDC's decision to initiate the investigation: </strong></p>
            <p>
              Costa Rica  also contested, under Article 5.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, the  sufficiency of certain evidence provided to the investigating authority by the  petitioner. Costa Rica argued in particular that the sales invoices provided by  the complainant as evidence of price referred to only one type of  corrugated steel rod, concerned a very low volume, and were issued very close  succession, almost a year before the filing of the initiation application. The Panel  disagreed with Costa Rica that the invoices presented as evidence  of normal value were not &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; evidence within the meaning of  Article 5.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </p>
            <p> <strong>Other procedural  claims raised by Costa Rica: </strong></p>
            <p>
              Costa Rica  made several additional claims regarding the conduct of the investigation by  the investigating authority: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The  Panel agreed with Costa Rica that the CDC had failed to provide the  &ldquo;complete&rdquo; text of the petition for initiation &ldquo;as soon&rdquo; as  the investigation was initiated, inconsistently with Article 6.1.3 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement. The CDC had provided interested parties the complete  initiation petition and accompanying documents almost four months after  initiation. </li>
              <li>The  Panel rejected Costa Rica's claims under Article 6.4 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement that the CDC did not  provide the interested parties due opportunity to examine relevant information obtained from the petitioner during  verification. The Panel rejected Costa Rica's argument that the information in  question was erroneously treated as confidential, and thus concluded that the investigating  authority was not required to provide interested parties the opportunity in a  timely manner to examine the information. </li>
              <li>The  Panel also rejected Costa Rica's claim under Article 6.5 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement that the CDC did not  provide sufficient justification for granting confidential treatment to certain  information provided by the domestic industry. The Panel found that the  CDC had in fact required the applicant to justify the confidential nature of  the information and had objectively considered the nature of the information  and the harm that could result from the disclosure of the information.</li>
              <li>The  Panel found no basis for Costa Rica's claim that the CDC acted inconsistently  with Article 6.7 and Annex I of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, by failing  to indicate to the exporter prior to  verification that it should provide information on domestic sales that were  made prior to the period of investigation of dumping. The Panel found that verification visits are  not the only means or moment in which an investigating authority can verify the  accuracy of the information submitted by interested parties or request them to  submit additional information, that thus, the CDC did not have an obligation to indicate to the  exporter that it should submit additional information. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Panel's recommendation and suggestion</strong></p>
            <p>
              The Panel recommended that the Dominican Republic bring its measures  into conformity with its obligations under the Anti-Dumping Agreement.</p>
          </div>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>On 18 September 2023, the Dominican Republic notified  the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law  and legal interpretations in the panel report. The Dominican Republic indicated  that given that the Appellate Body was temporarily unable to function, and in  the interests of fairness and orderly procedure in the conduct of the appeal, the  Dominican Republic would await instructions regarding any further steps to be  taken in this appeal.</p>
