        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaints by Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and the United States.</strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The complainants in this case other than Ecuador had  requested consultations with the European Communities on the same issue on 28  September 1995 (<a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds16_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS16</a>). After Ecuador&rsquo;s  accession to the WTO, the current complainants again requested consultations  with the European&nbsp;Communities on 5&nbsp;February 1996. The complainants  alleged that the European Communities&rsquo; regime for importation, sale and  distribution of bananas is inconsistent with Articles I, II, III, X, XI and XIII of the GATT 1994 as well as  provisions of the Import Licensing Agreement, the Agreement on Agriculture, the  TRIMs Agreement and the GATS.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 11   April 1996, the five complainants requested the establishment of a  panel. At its meeting on 24   April 1996, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Further to a second request  by the five complainants, a panel was established at the DSB meeting on 8 May 1996. On 29 May 1996, the five  complainants requested the Director-General to determine the composition of the  Panel. On 7 June 1996,  the panel was composed. The panel report was circulated to Members on 22 May 1997. The panel  found that the European Communities&rsquo; banana import regime and the licensing  procedures for the importation of bananas in this regime are inconsistent with  the GATT 1994. The panel further found that the Lom&eacute; waiver waives the  inconsistency with Article XIII of the GATT 1994, but found no inconsistencies  arising from the licensing system.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 11 June 1997, the  European Communities notified its intention to appeal certain issues of law and  legal interpretations developed by the Panel. The Appellate Body report was  circulated to Members on 9   September 1997. The Appellate Body mostly upheld the panel&rsquo;s  findings, but reversed the panel&rsquo;s findings that the inconsistency with Article  XIII of the GATT&nbsp;1994 is waived by the Lom&eacute; waiver, and that certain  aspects of the licensing regime violated Article X of GATT 1994 and the Import  Licensing Agreement.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 25 September 1997, the  Appellate Body report and the Panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body,  were adopted by the DSB.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Compliance proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 18 August 1998, further  to the European Communities&rsquo; revision of their legislation and despite holding  that Article 21.5 does not require parties to consult as a prior condition to resort  to these proceedings the complainants requested, in the interest of avoiding  any further delay, consultations with the European Communities&nbsp; for the resolution of the disagreement  between them over the WTO-consistency of measures introduced by the European Communities  in purported compliance with the recommendations and rulings of the Panel and  Appellate Body The European Communities then adopted a second Regulation which  it said completed the implementation of the recommendations and rulings  regarding this dispute insofar as its new system would be fully applicable from  1 January 1999, date of the expiry of the RPT. On 13 November 1998, Ecuador  requested the reactivation of consultations initiated by a letter sent jointly  with the other co-complainants on 18 August 1998 and held on 17 September 1998.  On 18 November 1998, the European Communities confirmed their willingness to  reactivate the consultations with a view to concluding the discussion of the  subjects that were not discussed during the September consultations.  Consultations between Ecuador and the European Communities took place on 23  November 1998 with the presence of Mexico who joined as a co-complainant in the  same meeting.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 15 December 1998 the European  Communities requested the establishment of a panel under Article 21.5 (the EC  compliance panel). &nbsp;The European Communities'  request for a compliance panel was made in response to measures taken by the United&nbsp;States  regarding the EC implementing measures, which the United States considered had  failed to implement the WTO recommendations.&nbsp;  More specifically, the European Communities requested the compliance  panel to determine that the EC implementing measures must be presumed to  conform to WTO rules unless challenged in accordance with DSU procedures. &nbsp;The complainants other than Ecuador objected  in writing to the fact that the European Communities' request be considered as  constituting recourse to Article&nbsp;21.5 alleging that there was no  procedural basis for treating a forthcoming meeting as the second DSB meeting  at which the panel could be established and that the European Communities had  not satisfied its own stipulated precondition for the lodging of such request  insofar as it had not sought consultations on the matter. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 18 December 1998, Ecuador  requested the re-establishment of the original panel to examine whether the EC  measures to implement the recommendations of the DSB were WTO-consistent.  (Ecuador compliance panel). </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 12 January  1999, the DSB agreed to reconvene the original panel, pursuant to Article 21.5  of the DSU, to examine both Ecuador&rsquo;s and the European Communities&rsquo; compliance  panel requests. Jamaica, Nicaragua, Colombia, Costa Rica, C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire,  Dominican Republic, Dominica, St. Lucia, Mauritius, St. Vincent, indicated  their interest to join as third parties in both requests, while Ecuador and  India indicated their third-party interest only in the European Communities'  request. The four original complaining parties other than Ecuador (i.e.  Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and the United States) refrained from requesting a  panel or from joining the procedure initiated by Ecuador. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 14 January 1999, the United  States requested pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU, the DSB's authorization  to suspend concessions or other obligations (see below). On 8 November 1999, and  prior to the adoption of the reports of the European Communities and Ecuador compliance  panels, Ecuador also requested authorization from the DSB to suspend the  application to the European Communities of concessions or other related  obligations (see below).&nbsp; On 18 January  1999, the compliance panels were composed. The two compliance panel reports  were circulated on 12 April 1999. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The EC compliance panel  found that, because a challenge had actually been made by Ecuador regarding the  WTO-consistency of the EC measures taken in implementation of the DSB  recommendations, it was unable to agree with the European&nbsp;Communities that  the European Communities must be presumed to be in compliance with the  recommendations of the DSB. The report of the EC compliance panel was never  adopted by the DSB. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The compliance panel  requested by Ecuador found that the implementation measures taken by the European  Communities in compliance with the recommendations of the DSB were not fully  compatible with the European Communities' WTO obligations. The report of the Ecuador  compliance panel was adopted by the DSB on 6 May 1999. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Proceedings under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 14 January 1999, the United States requested,  pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU,&nbsp; the  DSB's authorization to suspend of concessions or other obligations to the European  Communities in an amount of USD520 million. The European Communities objected  to the level of suspension proposed by the United States on the ground that it  was not equivalent to the level of nullification or impairment of benefits  suffered by the United States and claimed that the principles and procedures  set out in Article 22.3 of the DSU had not been followed. Pursuant to Article  22.6 of the DSU, the European Communities requested that the original panel  carry out the arbitration on the level of suspension of concessions requested  by the United States. The DSB referred the issue of the level of suspension to  the original panel for arbitration on 29 January 1999. &nbsp;The &nbsp;decision by the arbitrator was circulated on 9  April 1999.&nbsp; The Arbitrator found that  the level of suspension sought by the United States was not equivalent to the  level of nullification and impairment suffered as a result of the EC&rsquo;s new  banana regime not being fully compatible with the WTO. The Arbitrator  accordingly determined the level of nullification suffered by the United States  to be equal to USD191.4 million per year and that the suspension by the United  States of the application to the European Communities and its member States of  tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 covering trade in a  maximum amount of USD191.4 million per year would be consistent with Article  22.4 of the DSU. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 9 April 1999, the United States, pursuant to  Article&nbsp;22.7 of the DSU, requested that the DSB authorize suspension of  concessions to the European Communities equivalent to the level of  nullification and impairment, i.e. USD191.4 million. On 19 April 1999, the DSB  authorized the United States to suspend concessions to the European Communities  as requested.On 8 November 1999, and prior to the adoption of the compliance  panel report by Ecuador (see above), Ecuador requested authorization from the  DSB to suspend the application to the European&nbsp;Communities of concessions or  other related obligations under the TRIPS Agreement, GATS and GATT 1994,  pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU, in an amount of USD450 million. At the DSB  meeting on 19 November 1999, the European Communities objected to the proposed  level of suspension alleging it exceeded the level of nullification or  impairment Ecuador had suffered and to Ecuador's request for cross-retaliation  stating Ecuador has not followed the principles and procedures set forth in  Article 22.3 of the DSU. The European Communities &nbsp;therefore requested, &nbsp;pursuant to Article 22.6 of the DSU, the  matter be referred to arbitration.. At its meeting on 19 November 1999, the DSB  referred the issue to the original panel for arbitration in accordance with  Article 22.6 of the DSU.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The Arbitrator's decision on the Ecuadorian request for  suspension of concessions was circulated to Members on 24 March 2000. The Arbitrator  found that the level of nullification and impairment suffered by Ecuador  amounted to USD201.6 million per year. The Arbitrator found that Ecuador's  request for retaliation did not follow the principles and procedures set forth  in Article 22.3, especially regarding the suspension of concessions under the  GATT 1994 with respect to goods destined for final consumption and that the level  of suspension requested by Ecuador exceeded the level of nullification and  impairment suffered by it as a result of the European Communities' failures to  bring the EC banana import regime into compliance with WTO law within the RPT.  Accordingly, the Arbitrator found that Ecuador may request authorization by the  DSB to suspend concessions or other obligations under GATT 1994 (not including  investment goods or primary goods used as inputs in manufacturing and  processing industries); under GATS with respect to &ldquo;wholesale trade services&rdquo;  (CPC 622) in the principal distribution services; and, to the extent that  suspension requested under GATT 1994 and GATS was insufficient to reach the  level of nullification and impairment determined by the Arbitrator, under TRIPS  in the following sectors of that Agreement: Section 1 (copyright and related  rights); Article&nbsp;14 on protection of performers, producers of phonograms  and broadcasting organisations), Section 3 (geographical indications), Section  4 (industrial designs). The Arbitrator also noted that, pursuant to  Article&nbsp;22.3 of the DSU, Ecuador should first seek to suspend concessions  or other obligations with respect to the same sectors as those in which the  panel reconvened at the request of Ecuador pursuant to Article 21.5 of the DSU  had found violations, i.e. GATT 1994 and the sector of distribution services  under GATS. On 8 May 2000,  Ecuador  requested, pursuant to Article 22.7 of the DSU, that the DSB authorize the  suspension of concessions to the EC equivalent to the level of nullification  and impairment, i.e. US$201.6 million. On 18 May 2000, the DSB authorized Ecuador to  suspend concessions to the European Communities as requested.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Compliance proceedings (second recourse)</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 30 November 2005, Honduras,  Nicaragua and Panama requested consultations with the European Communities  under Article 21.5 of the DSU concerning the measures adopted on 29&nbsp;November  2005 by the European Communities to address the requirements provided for by  the Waiver adopted in Doha Ministerial in November 2001 with regard to banana  trade (&ldquo;Doha Waiver&rdquo;) (see below). The measures at issue are relevant  provisions of the recently passed EC Council Regulation governing the import  regime for banana.&nbsp; The measures at issues were adopted following two  Arbitrations under the Doha Waiver, both of which ruled against previous  proposals by the European Communities to address the same matter. According to  the requests, the EC Council Regulation is WTO-inconsistent in the following  respects: </p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>The 176&euro;/mt MFN rate is inconsistent with the  Doha Waiver in all its parts, the Arbitration Awards of 1 August and 27 October  2005, GATT Article XXVIII, and the Appellate Body report and the Panel report  as modified by the Appellate Body Report in EC-Bananas III; and <br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>The zero-duty ACP tariff quota of 775,000 mt and  over-quota ACP tariff of 176&euro;/mt are inconsistent with the Doha Waiver in all  its parts, the Arbitration Awards of 1 August and 27 October 2005, GATT  Articles I and XIII, and the Appellate Body report and the Panel report as  modified by the Appellate Body Report in EC-Bananas III. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 16 November 2006, Ecuador  requested consultations under Article 21.5 of the DSU and Article&nbsp;XXIII of  the GATT 1994 with respect to  measures taken by the European Communities to comply with the recommendations  and rulings contained in Council Regulation No. 1964/2005 (&ldquo;Regulation  1964&rdquo;) and its associated implementing regulations taken in the framework  of the two &ldquo;Understandings on Bananas&rdquo; the European Communities  reached in April 2001 with the United&nbsp;States and Ecuador (see below). On  28 November 2006, Ecuador submitted a revised request for consultations under  Article 21.5 of the DSU and Article XXII of the GATT  1994.&nbsp;On 30&nbsp;November 2006, Belize, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Dominica, the Dominican Republic,  St.&nbsp;Lucia, St.&nbsp;Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname  requested to join the consultations. On 4 December 2006, Cameroon requested to join the  consultations. On 6 December   2006, Jamaica  requested to join the consultations. On 11 December 2006, Panama and the United States  requested to join the consultations. The European Communities informed the DSB  that they had accepted all the requests to join the consultations.&nbsp; On 23 February 2007, Ecuador  requested the establishment of a compliance panel.&nbsp; At its meeting on 20 February 2007, the DSB  deferred the establishment of a compliance panel.&nbsp; At its meeting on 20 March 2007, the DSB  agreed to refer to the original panel, if possible, the question of whether the  new EC banana regime was in conformity with the DSB's recommendations and  rulings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cameroon,  Colombia,  C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire,  Dominica,  the Dominican Republic,  Ghana,  Jamaica,  Japan,  St. Kitts and Nevis,  St. Lucia,&nbsp;St. Vincent and the Grenadines,  and the United States  reserved their third-party rights.&nbsp; Subsequently, Belize, Brazil, Madagascar, Nicaragua, Panama and Suriname  reserved their third-party rights. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">          On 5 June 2007, Ecuador requested the  Director-General to determine the composition of the compliance panel.&nbsp; On  15 June 2007, the  Director-General composed the compliance panel.&nbsp; On 5 December 2007, the Chairman of the compliance  panel informed the DSB that it would not be possible to circulate its report  within 90 days after the date of referral.&nbsp; The compliance panel expected  to issue its final report to parties in December 2007 and, following  translation, the final report was expected to be circulated to Members in  February 2008. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 29 June 2007, the United  States requested the establishment of a compliance panel as it considered that  the European Communities had failed to bring its import regime for bananas into  compliance with its WTO obligations and the regime remains inconsistent.&nbsp;  At its meeting on 12 July   2007, the DSB referred the matter to the original panel, if  possible.&nbsp; Brazil,  Cameroon,  Colombia,  the Dominican Republic,  Ecuador,  Jamaica,  Japan,  Nicaragua  and Panama  reserved their third-party rights. Subsequently, Belize, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Dominica, Mexico,&nbsp;St. Lucia,  St&nbsp;.Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname  reserved their third-party rights. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 3 August 2007, the United  States requested the Director-General to determine the composition of the compliance  panel.&nbsp; On 13 August   2007, the Director-General composed the compliance panel.&nbsp; On 21 February 2008, the  Chairman of the compliance panel informed the DSB that it would not be possible  to circulate its report within 90 days after the date of referral.&nbsp; The compliance  panel expected to issue its final report to parties no later than the end of  the first week of March 2008. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 7 April 2008, the compliance panel  report requested by Ecuador  was circulated to Members.&nbsp; The Panel rejected the preliminary issue  raised by the European Communities that Ecuador is prevented from challenging  the EC current import regime for bananas, including the preference for ACP countries, because of the Understanding on  Bananas, signed by both Members in April 2001.&nbsp; Accordingly, and after  having examined the substantive claims raised by Ecuador as well as the defences  invoked by the European Communities, the compliance panel concluded that: </p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>The  preference granted by the European Communities to an annual duty-free tariff  quota of 775,000 mt of imported bananas originating in ACP countries  constitutes an advantage for this category of bananas, which is not accorded to  like bananas originating in non-ACP WTO Members, and is therefore inconsistent  with Article I:1 of GATT 1994; <br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>With  the expiration of the Doha Waiver from 1 January 2006 as it applied to bananas,  there is no evidence that, during the period that is relevant for this Panel's  findings, that is, from the time of the establishment of the Panel until the  date of this Report, any waiver from Article I:1 of GATT 1994 has been in force  to cover the preference granted by the European Communities to the duty-free  tariff quota of imported bananas originating in ACP countries;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>The  EC current banana import regime, in particular its preferential tariff quota  reserved for ACP countries, is inconsistent with Article XIII:1, with the  chapeau of Article XIII:2, and with Article XIII:2(d) of the GATT  1994;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>The  tariff applied by the European Communities to MFN imports of bananas, set at  &euro;176/mt, without consideration of the tariff quota for 2.2 million mt bound at  an in-quota tariff rate of &euro;75/mt, is an ordinary customs duty in excess of  that set forth and provided for in Part I of the EC Schedule.&nbsp; This tariff  is therefore inconsistent with the first sentence of Article II:1(b) of the  GATT 1994;&nbsp; and,<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
          <li>It  is unnecessary, for the resolution of this dispute, to make a separate finding  on Ecuador's  claim under Article II:1(a) of the GATT 1994. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">In consequence, the compliance  panel concluded that, through its current regime for the importation of  bananas, established in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1964/2005 of 29 November  2005, including the duty-free tariff quota for bananas originating in ACP countries and the MFN tariff currently set at  &euro;176/mt, the European Communities had failed to implement the recommendations  and rulings of the DSB. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The compliance panel  recommended that the DSB request the European Communities to bring the  inconsistent measures into conformity with its obligations under the GATT 1994. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 19 May 2008, the compliance panel  report requested by the United    States was circulated to Members.&nbsp;  Regarding the preliminary objections advanced by the European Communities, the compliance  panel found that: </p>

&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>the  European Communities has failed in making a case that the United States'  complaint under Article 21.5 of the DSU should be rejected, because the EC  current import regime for bananas, including the preference for ACP countries,  is not a &ldquo;measure taken to comply&rdquo; with the recommendations and rulings of the  DSB in the original proceedings. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The compliance panel accordingly rejected the  preliminary issues raised by the European Communities. </p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
          <li>the  EC current banana import regime, in particular its preferential tariff quota  reserved for ACP countries, is also inconsistent with Article XIII:1 and Article  XIII:2 of the GATT 1994; </li>

        <p class="paranormaltext">In consequence, the compliance  panel concluded that, through its current regime for the importation of  bananas, established in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1964/2005 of 29 November  2005, in particular its duty-free tariff quota for bananas originating in ACP countries, the European Communities had failed  to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The compliance panel also  concluded that, to the extent that the current EC bananas import regime  contains measures inconsistent with various provisions of the GATT 1994, it has nullified or impaired benefits  accruing to the United States under that Agreement. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Since the original DSB  recommendations and rulings in this dispute remain operative through the  results of the current compliance proceedings, the compliance panel made no new  recommendation. </p>

        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 26 November 2008, the Appellate Body  reports were circulated to Members. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> In the appeal of the compliance  panel report requested by Ecuador, with respect to procedural issues, the  Appellate Body found the compliance panel did not act inconsistently with  Article&nbsp;9.3 of the DSU by maintaining different timetables in the  Article&nbsp;21.5 proceedings between the European Communities and Ecuador and  between the European Communities and the United States; and upheld the compliance  panel's finding, albeit for different reasons, that Ecuador was not barred by  the Understanding on Bananas from initiating this compliance proceeding. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> With respect to  Article&nbsp;XIII of the GATT  1994, the Appellate Body upheld the compliance panel's findings that, to the  extent that the European Communities argues that it has implemented a  suggestion pursuant to Article&nbsp;19.1 of the DSU, the compliance panel was  not prevented from conducting, under Article&nbsp;21.5 of the DSU, the  assessment requested by Ecuador; and that, therefore, the compliance panel did  not need to assess whether the European&nbsp;Communities has effectively  implemented any of the suggestions of the first compliance panel requested by  Ecuador. The Appellate Body also upheld, albeit for different reasons, the compliance  panel's finding that the EC Bananas Import Regime, in particular, its duty-free  tariff quota reserved for ACP  countries, was inconsistent with Article&nbsp;XIII:1 and Article&nbsp;XIII:2 of  the GATT&nbsp;1994. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> With respect to Article&nbsp;II  of the GATT 1994, the Appellate  Body reversed the compliance panel's finding that the Doha Article&nbsp;I  Waiver constituted a subsequent agreement between the parties extending the  tariff quota concession for bananas listed in the European Communities' Schedule  of Concessions beyond 31&nbsp;December 2002, until the rebinding of the EC  tariff on bananas. The Appellate Body also reversed the compliance panel's  finding that the E C' tariff quota concession for bananas was intended to  expire on 31 December 2002 on account of paragraph 9 of the Bananas Framework  Agreement. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body upheld,  albeit for different reasons, the compliance panel's findings that the tariff  applied by the European Communities to MFN imports of bananas, set at &euro;176/mt,  without consideration of the tariff quota of 2.2&nbsp;million mt bound at an  in-quota tariff rate of &euro;75/mt, is an ordinary customs duty in excess of that  provided for in the EC Schedule of Concessions, and thus inconsistent with  Article&nbsp;II:1(b) of the GATT  1994 and that the European Communities, by maintaining measures inconsistent  with different provisions of the GATT  1994, including Article XIII, had nullified or impaired benefits accruing to  Ecuador under that Agreement. </p>

The Appellate Body also found that the compliance  panel did not err in making findings with respect to a measure that had ceased  to exist subsequent to the establishment of the compliance panel, but before  the compliance panel issued its report. The Appellate Body also found that the  deficiencies in the European Communities' Notice of Appeal do not lead to  dismissal of the European Communities' appeal. </p>

        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 19  November 1999 and following the first series of compliance panel proceedings  (see above), the European Communities informed the DSB of its proposal for  reform of the banana regime, which envisages a two-stage process, comprising a  tariff rate quota system for several years. This system should then be replaced  by a tariff only system no later than 1 January 2006. The proposal includes a decision to  continue discussions with interested parties on the possible systems for  distribution of licences for the tariff rate quota regime. If no feasible  system can be found, the proposal for a transitional tariff rate quota regime  would not be maintained and negotiations under Article XXVIII of GATT 1994  would be envisaged to replace the current system with a tariff only regime. At the  DSB meeting on 24 February 2000, the EC explained that there continued to be  divergent views expressed by the main parties concerned and that, as a result,  no agreed conclusions could be reached. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting of 27  July 2000 and following the Arbitrator's decision on the Ecuadorian request for  suspension of concessions (see above), the European Communities stated with  respect to implementation of the recommendations of the DSB that it had begun  examining the possibility of managing the proposed tariff rate quotas on a  first come, first served basis because negotiations with interested parties on  tariff rate quota allocation on the basis of traditional trade flows had  reached an impasse. The European Communities also said that its examination  would include a tariff only system and its implications. At the DSB meeting of 23 October 2000, the European  Communities stated that it was finalizing its internal decision-making process  with a view to implementing the new banana regime. To this effect, the European  Communities considered that, during a transitional period of time, its new  banana regime should be regulated by the establishment of tariff-rate quotas  and managed on the basis of a &ldquo;first-come, first-served&rdquo; (FCFS) system. Before  the end of transitional period of time, the European Communities would initiate  Article XXVIII negotiations with a view to establishing a tariff-only system.  On 1 March 2001,  the European Communities reported to the DSB that on 29 January 2001, the Council of the  European Union adopted Regulation (EC) No 216/2001 amending Regulation (EEC) No  404/93 on the common organisation of the market in bananas. The modifications  made in Council Regulation 216/2001 provide for three tariff quotas open to all  imports irrespective of their origin: (1) a first tariff quota of 2.200.000  tonnes at a rate of 75&euro;/tonnes, bound under the WTO; (2) a second autonomous  quota of 353.000 tonnes at a rate of 75&euro;/tonnes; (3) a third autonomous quota  of 850.000 tonnes at a rate of 300&euro;/tonnes. Imports from ACP countries will  enter duty-free. In view of contractual obligations towards these countries and  the need to guarantee proper conditions of competition, they will benefit from  a tariff preference limited to a maximum of 300&euro;/tonnes. The tariff quotas are  a transitional measure leading ultimately to a tariff-only regime. According to  the European Communities, substantial progress has been achieved with respect  to the implementing measures necessary to manage the three tariff rate quotas  on the basis of the First-come, First-served method.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 3 May 2001, the European Communities  reported to the DSB that intensive discussions with the United States and Ecuador, as  well as the other banana supplying countries, including the other co&#8209;complainants,  have led to the common identification of the means by which the long-standing  dispute over the EC&rsquo;s bananas import regime will be resolved. In accordance  with Article 16(1) of Regulation No (EC) 404/93 (as amended by Council  Regulation No (EC)&nbsp;216/2001), the EC will introduce a Tariff Only regime  for imports of bananas no later than 1 January 2006. GATT Article&nbsp;XXVIII negotiations will  be initiated in good time to that effect. In the interim period, starting on  1&nbsp;July 2001, the European Communities will implement an import regime  based on three tariff rate quotas, to be allocated on the basis of historical  licensing.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 22 June 2001, the European Communities  notified an &ldquo;Understanding on Bananas between the European Communities and the  United States&rdquo; of 11 April   2001, and an &ldquo;Understanding on Bananas between the European Communities  and Ecuador&rdquo;  of 30 April 2001.  Pursuant to these Understandings with the United States and Ecuador, the European  Communities will implement an import regime on the basis of historical  licensing as follows:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>effective  1 July 2001, the European  Communities will implement an import regime on the basis of historical  licensing as set out in annex to each of the Understandings;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>effective  as soon as possible thereafter, subject to Council and European Parliament  approval and to adoption of an Article XIII waiver, the European Communities  will implement an import regime on the basis of historical licensing as set out  in annex to each of the Understandings. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The Commission will seek to obtain the implementation  of such an import regime as soon as possible. Pursuant to its Understanding  with the European Communities, the United States:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>upon implementation of the new import regime  described under (1) above, would provisionally suspend its imposition of the  increased duties;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>upon implementation of the new import regime  described under (2) above, would terminate its imposition of the increased  duties;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>may reimpose the increased duties if the import  regime described under (2) does not enter into force by 1 January 2002; and<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>would lift its reserve concerning the waiver of  Article I of the GATT 1994 that the EC has requested for preferential access to  the EC of goods originating in ACP states signatory to the Cotonou Agreement;  and will actively work towards promoting the acceptance of an EC request for a  waiver of Article XIII of the GATT 1994 needed for the management of quota C  under the import regime described under (2) above until 31 December 2005. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">Pursuant to its Understanding with the European Communities,  Ecuador:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>took note that the European Commission will  examine the trade in organic bananas and report accordingly by 31 December 2004;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>upon implementation of the new import regime,  Ecuador&rsquo;s right to suspend concessions or other obligations of a level not  exceeding US$201.6 million per year vis-&agrave;-vis the EC would be terminated;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>Ecuador would lift its reserve concerning the  waiver of Article I of the GATT 1994 that the European Communities has  requested for preferential access to the European Communities of goods  originating in ACP states signatory to the Cotonou Agreement; and would  actively work towards promoting the acceptance of an EC request for a waiver of  Article XIII of the GATT 1994 needed for the management of quota C under the  import regime described in paragraph C(2) until 31 December 2005. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The European Communities  notified the Understandings as mutually satisfactory solutions within the  meaning of Article 3.6 of the DSU. Both Ecuador and the United States  communicated that the Understandings did not constitute mutually satisfactory  solutions within the meaning of Article 3.6 of the DSU and that it would be  premature to take the item off the DSB agenda. At the DSB meeting on 25 September 2001, Ecuador made an  oral statement whereby it criticised the Commission proposal aimed at reforming  the EC common organization for bananas in order to honour the above  Understandings.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 4 October 2001, the European Communities  circulated a status report on the implementation where it indicated that it was  continuing to work actively on the legal instruments required for the  management of the three tariff quotas after 1 January 2002. In addition, the European Communities&rsquo;  report indicated that no progress had been made since the previous DSB meeting  regarding the waiver request submitted by the European Communities and the ACP States.  The European Communities further indicated that in the event that no progress  was made at the meeting of the Council of Trade in Goods scheduled for 5 October 2001, the European  Communities and the ACP   States would be forced to  reassess the situation in all respects. At the DSB meeting on 15 October 2001, the European  Communities recalled that the procedure for the examination of the waiver  request had been unblocked at the meeting of the Council for Trade in Goods on 5 October 2001, and  expressed its readiness to work and discuss with all interested parties in the  course of this examination. Ecuador  said that if the waiver was limited to what was required during the  transitional import regime then it could be granted quickly. Guatemala said  that it would carefully follow the outcome of the European Communities&rsquo; actions  and requested that the item should remain on the DSB agenda. Honduras noted  that the European Communities had an obligation to describe the measures to be  put in place after 2005. It also reiterated its concerns that the rights of  developing countries were not being respected. Panama supported the statement by Honduras and  urged the European Communities to take into account the concerns of Latin  American banana exporters. The United States expressed satisfaction that the  examination procedure of the waiver request had started and hoped that the  process would be expeditious. St. Lucia said that the statement by Honduras that  the European Communities disregarded the rights of some developing countries  was inaccurate. It welcomed the start of the examination procedure and hoped  that any current differences would soon be resolved. At the DSB meeting on 5 November 2001, the European  Communities informed that the Working Party to examine the waiver requests  submitted by the European Communities and ACP had made some progress. Ecuador said  that tariff preferences to be applied by the European Communities would  reproduce the same inconsistencies in the banana import regime. Honduras  indicated that it was necessary to ensure that the scope of the waiver did not  go beyond what was required for the implementation of the new regime. Panama said  that even if the waiver was granted, the dispute would not be settled.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 18 December 2001, the European  Communities welcomed the granting of the two waivers by the Ministerial  Conference, which were the prerequisite for the implementation of phase II of  the Understandings reached with the United States and Ecuador. The European  Communities noted that the Regulation implementing phase II would be adopted on  19 December 2001,  with effect on 1 January 2002.  Ecuador,  Honduras,  Panama  and Colombia  noted the progress made and sought information from the European Communities  concerning the granting of import licences by one EC member State in a manner  that was inconsistent with the Understandings. On 21&nbsp;January 2002, the European  Communities announced that Regulation (EC) No. 2587/2001 had been adopted by  the Council on 19 December 2001 and indicated that through this Regulation the  European Communities had implemented phase 2 of the Understandings with the United  States and Ecuador. Pursuant to the Understandings on Bananas and the Doha  Waiver, the European Communities adopted the 2005 Regulation which was challenged  in the second series of compliance panel proceedings (see above). Following the  Appellate Body reports in such compliance proceedings, the European Communities  informed the DSB on 9 January 2009 that it intends to bring itself into  compliance with its recommendations and rulings by modifying its scheduled  tariff commitments on bananas through an agreement on the level of the new EC  bound tariff duty with Latin American banana supplying countries pursuant to negotiations  under Article XXVIII of the GATT.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At  the DSB meeting on 21 December 2009, the European Union reported that it had  reached a historic agreement with Latin American banana suppliers the previous  week (the so-called &ldquo;Geneva Agreement on Trade in  Bananas&rdquo;). &nbsp;The agreement, together with an agreement  regarding the settlement of the case brought by the United  States, had been initialled on  15 December 2009.&nbsp; Those  agreements provided for final settlement of all current disputes regarding the  EU import regime on bananas upon certification of a new EU tariff schedule on  bananas. On 7 January 2010, the European Union  and Ecuador notified the DSB   that in light of the Geneva Agreement on Trade in Bananas,  it was not necessary for the European  Union to continue to provide status reports in this dispute while the European  Union is taking the necessary steps to implement the terms of the Agreement. </p>

        <h3>Mutually agreed solution</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 8 November 2012, the  parties notified the DSB of a mutually agreed  solution pursuant to  Article&nbsp;3.6 of the DSU.</p>
