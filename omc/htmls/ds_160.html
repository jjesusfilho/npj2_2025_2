		<h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the European  Communities and their member   States. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 26 January 1999, the European Communities  requested consultations with the United States in respect of Section 110(5) of  the US Copyright Act, as amended by the Fairness in Music Licensing Act, which  was enacted on 27 October   1998. The European Communities contended that Section&nbsp;110(5)  of the US Copyright Act permits, under certain conditions, the playing of radio  and television music in public places (bars, shops, restaurants, etc.) without  the payment of a royalty fee. The European Communities considered that this  statute is inconsistent with US obligations under Article 9(1) of the TRIPS  Agreement, which requires Members to comply with Articles 1-21 of the Berne  Convention.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> The dispute centred on the  compatibility of two exemptions provided for in Section 110(5) of the US  Copyright Act with Article 13 of the TRIPS Agreement, which allows certain  limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights of copyright holders, subject to  the condition that such limitations are confined to certain special cases, do  not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work in question and do not  unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>The so-called &ldquo;business&rdquo; exemption, provided for  in sub-paragraph (B) of Section 110(5), essentially allows the amplification of  music broadcasts, without an authorization and a payment of a fee, by food  service and drinking establishments and by retail establishments, provided that  their size does not exceed a certain square footage limit. It also allows such  amplification of music broadcasts by establishments above this square footage  limit, provided that certain equipment limitations are met.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li>The so-called &ldquo;homestyle&rdquo; exemption, provided  for in sub-paragraph (A) of Section 110(5), allows small restaurants and retail  outlets to amplify music broadcasts without an authorization of the right  holders and without the payment of a fee, provided that they use only homestyle  equipment (i.e. equipment of a kind commonly used in private homes). </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 15 April 1999, the European Communities requested  the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 28 April 1999, the DSB deferred  the establishment of a panel. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Further to a second request  to establish a panel by the European Communities, the DSB established a panel  at its meeting on 26 May 1999. Brazil,  Australia,  Canada,  Japan  and Switzerland  reserved their third-party rights. On 27 July 1999, the European Communities requested the  Director-in-Charge to determine the composition of the panel. On 6 August 1999, the panel was  composed. The panel report was circulated to Members on 15 June 2000. The panel found that:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li>the &ldquo;business&rdquo; exemption provided for in  sub-paragraph (B) of Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act did not meet the  requirements of Article 13 of the TRIPS Agreement and was thus inconsistent  with Articles 11<em>bis</em>(1)(iii) and 11(1)(ii) of the Berne Convention (1971)  as incorporated into the TRIPS Agreement by Article 9.1 of that Agreement. The  panel noted, <em>inter alia</em>, that a substantial majority of eating and  drinking establishments and close to half of retail establishments were covered  by the business exemption.<br />
&nbsp;            &nbsp; </li>
          <li>the &ldquo;homestyle&rdquo; exemption provided for in  sub-paragraph (A) of Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act met the  requirements of Article 13 of the TRIPS Agreement and was thus consistent with  Articles 11<em>bis</em>(1)(iii) and 11(1)(ii) of the Berne Convention (1971) as  incorporated into the TRIPS Agreement by Article 9.1 of that Agreement. Here,  the panel noted certain limits imposed on the beneficiaries of the exemption,  permissible equipment and categories of works as well as the practice by US  courts. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">The DSB adopted the panel report  at its meeting on 27 July   2000.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3> Reasonable  period of time</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext">
          On 24 August 2000, the United States  informed the DSB that it would implement the recommendations of the DSB and proposed  15 months as a reasonable period of time within which to implement those  recommendations. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 23 October 2000, the European Communities  requested that the reasonable period of time for implementation be determined  by means of binding arbitration as provided for in Article 21.3(c) DSU. The  Arbitrator circulated his Award on 15 January 2001. The Arbitrator determined that the  reasonable period of time for the United States to implement the  recommendations and rulings of the DSB in this case is 12 months from the date  of the adoption of the panel report i.e. it expired on 27&nbsp;July&nbsp;2001.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 18 December 2001, the United  States indicated that it was engaged in productive discussions with the European  Communities with a view to resolving the dispute before the end of the expiry  of the reasonable period of time. The European Communities underlined that the  resolution of the dispute required an amendment of the WTO-inconsistent  legislation. The European Communities stated that if it was not possible to  conclude any arrangements before the end of the reasonable period of time, it  would have to seek the DSB&rsquo;s authorization to suspend concessions or other  obligations under Article 22.2 of the DSU. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting of 24 July 2001, the DSB  agreed to the United States' proposal to extend the reasonable period of time  until 31 December 2001  or the end of the current session of the US&nbsp;Congress, whichever was earlier.  This extension had been agreed with the European Communities.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Arbitration under  Article 25</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 23 July 2001, the United States  and the European Communities informed the DSB of their agreement to resort to  arbitration pursuant to Article 25 of the DSU in order to determine the level  of nullification or impairment of benefits to the European Communities as  result of Section 110(5)(B) of the US Copyright Act and notified they had  agreed on the procedure and timetable for the proceedings. The parties  requested that the original panelists in the dispute be contacted to determine  their availability to serve as arbitrators in the proceedings and also requested  the Director-General's assistance in selecting alternative panelists in case of  unavailability of the original panelists. The parties agreed that the award of  the arbitrator shall be final and that they shall accept it as the level of  nullification or impairment for purposes of any future proceedings under  Article 22 of the DSU. The parties agreed that the members of the original  panel should serve as arbitrators. &nbsp;However,  as the Chairperson and one member of the original panel were no longer available,  the Director-General, in accordance with the agreed procedures for the  arbitration proceedings, appointed two arbitrators to replace them. On 9 November  2001, the arbitrator determined that the level of EC benefits which were being  nullified or impaired as a result of the operation of Section 110(5)(B)  amounted to &euro;1,219,900 per year.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3> Proceedings under  Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 7 January 2002, on the grounds that that  the United States had failed to bring its measures into conformity within the  reasonable period of time, the European Communities requested authorization to  suspend concessions pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU. Noting that the level  of EC benefits which had been nullified or impaired had been determined through  arbitration under Article 25 of the DSU, the European Communities proposed to  suspend concessions under the TRIPs Agreement and stated it would fix the  amount of a special fee from US nationals in connection with border measures  concerning copyright goods so as to ensure that the level of affected US  benefits will not exceed the level of EC benefits nullified or impaired as a  result of the WTO-inconsistent provisions of the US Copyright Act. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 17 January 2002, the United  States objected to the level of suspension of obligations proposed by the European  Communities and requested the DSB to refer the matter to arbitration, in  accordance with Article 22.6 of the DSU. The United States also claimed that  the principles and procedures of Article 22.3 had not been followed. During the  DSB meeting on 18 January 2002, the parties indicated, however, that they were  engaged in constructive negotiations and were hopeful of finding a mutually  satisfactory solution. On 26 February 2002, the parties requested the  arbitrator to suspend the arbitration proceeding, while noting that the  proceeding may be reactivated at the request of either party after 1 March  2002.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Implementation of  adopted reports</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 23 June 2003, the United States  and the European Communities informed the DSB of a mutually satisfactory  temporary arrangement. Such temporary arrangement covered the period through to  20&nbsp;December 2004.&nbsp; The United States  has thereafter presented status reports to the DSB informing that the  US&nbsp;Administration will work closely with the US&nbsp;Congress and will  continue to confer with the European&nbsp;Union in order to reach a mutually  satisfactory resolution of this matter.</p></div>
