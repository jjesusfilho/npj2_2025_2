		<h3>Consultations</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by the European Communities. (See also <a href="/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds162_e.htm" class="paracolourtext">DS162</a>) </strong></p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 9 June 1988, the European Communities requested  consultations with the United States in respect of the alleged failure of the United  States to repeal its Anti-Dumping Act of 1916. The European Communities  contended that the US Anti-Dumping Act of 1916 is still in force and is  applicable to the import and internal sale of any foreign product irrespective  of its origin, including products originating in countries which are WTO  Members. The European Communities also alleged that the 1916 Act exists in the  US statute books in parallel with the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, which  includes the US implementing legislation of multilateral Anti-Dumping  provisions. The European Communities alleged violations of Articles III:4, VI:1  and VI:2 of the GATT 1994, Article&nbsp;XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement, and  Articles 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 1 November 1998, the European Communities requested  the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 25 November 1998, the DSB  deferred the establishment of a panel. </p>
		<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> Further to a second request to establish a panel by the  European Communities, the DSB established a panel at its meeting on 1 February  1999. India, Japan and Mexico reserved their third-party rights. On 1 April  1999, the panel was composed.</p>
		<p class="paranormaltext"> On 31 March 2000, the panel report was circulated to  Members. The panel considered that:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">Article VI:1 of the GATT  1994 applies to any situation where a Member addresses the type of  transnational price discrimination defined in that Article.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">on the basis of the terms of the 1916 Act, its  legislative history and its interpretation by US courts, the transnational price  discrimination test found in the 1916 Act met the definition of Article VI:1 of  the GATT 1994.<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">by not providing exclusively for the injury test  set out in Article VI, the 1916 Act violated Article VI:1 of the GATT 1994;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">by providing for the imposition of treble  damages, fines or imprisonment, instead of anti&#8209;dumping duties, the 1916 Act  violated Article VI:2 of the GATT  1994;<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">by not providing for a number of procedural  requirements found in the Anti-Dumping Agreement, the 1916 Act violated Articles  1, 4 and 5.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement; and<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">by violating Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT  1994, the 1916 Act violated Article XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 29 May 2000, the United States notified the DSB of  its decision to appeal certain issues of law and legal interpretations  developed by the panel. The European Communities also notified its intention to  appeal certain issues of law and legal interpretations developed by the panel. The  Appellate Body examined this appeal with that of DS162. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 28 August 2000, the Appellate Body report was  circulated to Members. The Appellate Body upheld all of the findings and  conclusions of the panel that were appealed.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 26 September 2000, the DSB adopted  the Appellate Body report and the panel report, as upheld by the Appellate Body  report.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 23 October 2000, the United States  informed the DSB that it intended to implement the DSB recommendations and  rulings. The United States also stated that it would require a reasonable  period of time to do so and that it would consult with the European Communities  on this matter. On 17 November 2000, the European Communities requested that  the reasonable period of time be determined by arbitration pursuant to Article  21.3(c) of the DSU. The arbitrator circulated his award on 28 February 2001. He  decided that the reasonable period of time in this case was 10 months and would  thus expire on 26 July 2001. On 12 July 2001, the United&nbsp;States proposed  that the reasonable period of time for implementation be extended until 31&nbsp;December  2001 or the end of the current session of the US Congress, whichever was earlier  and informed the DSB it would consult with the European Communities on this  matter. The European Communities did not object to this proposal, which was agreed  by the DSB at its meeting on 24&nbsp;July 2001. At the DSB meeting on 18  December 2001, the United States informed the DSB that on 23&nbsp;July 2001 it  submitted proposed legislation to the US Congress repealing the 1916 Act and  terminating all pending actions under the Act. It added that, since the US  Congress had not yet been adjourned, the US Administration continued to seek  passage of the proposed legislation. The European Communities indicated that if  the United States failed to comply with the DSB recommendations, it would have  no choice but to request the authorization to suspend concessions or other  obligations under Article 22.2 of the DSU. </p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Proceedings under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 7 January 2002, on the grounds that that the United States  had failed to bring its measures into conformity within the reasonable period  of time, the European Communities requested authorization to suspend  concessions pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU. The European Communities  proposed that the suspension of concessions takes the form of an equivalent  legislation to the Anti-Dumping Act of 1916 against imports from the United States.  On 17 January 2002, the United States objected to the level of suspension of  obligations proposed by the European Communities and requested the DSB to refer  the matter to arbitration, in accordance with Article&nbsp;22.6 of the DSU. At  the DSB meeting on 18&nbsp;January 2002, it was agreed that the matter raised  by the United States be referred to arbitration. During the meeting, the  parties indicated that they were still engaged in consultations and would be  requesting the arbitrators, once appointed, to suspend their work with a view  to exploring the possibility of finding a mutually satisfactory solution. On 27  February 2002, the parties requested the Arbitrator to suspend the arbitration  proceeding noting that a proposal to repeal the 1916 Act and to terminate cases  pending under the Act was being examined by the US Congress. The parties noted,  however, that the arbitration proceeding could be reactivated at the request of  either party after 30 June 2002 if no substantial progress would have been made  in resolving the dispute by then.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 19 September 2003, the European Communities  requested the Arbitrator to reactivate the arbitration proceeding. In  accordance with the request from the European Communities, the Arbitrator  resumed the arbitration proceeding on the same day.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 24 February 2004, the decision by the Arbitrator was  circulated to Members. In light of the fact that the nullification or  impairment results from the 1916 Act &ldquo;as such&rdquo;, and not from particular  instances of application of that law, the Arbitrators decided to set a number  of parameters ((i) damages paid by EC companies as a result of judgements under  the 1916 Act and (ii) amount of any settlement reached between an EC company  and a US complainant pursuant to a 1916 Act complaint) with which the European Communities  will have to comply when calculating by itself the amount of countermeasures it  plans to impose, rather than setting a fixed value of trade which the European Communities  should not exceed when suspending its WTO obligations against the United&nbsp;States.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 26 November 2004, the United  States reported that the US Congress had completed steps to repeal the 1916  Act, thereby implementing the DSB's recommendations and rulings. At the DSB  meeting of 17 December 2004, the United States informed the DSB that on 3&nbsp;December 2004, the  US&nbsp;President had signed into law the Miscellaneous  Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2004. &nbsp;That Act included a provision that repealed  the 1916 Act. &nbsp;United&nbsp;States  reiterated its statement at the DSB November meeting that that action had brought  the United&nbsp;States into compliance with the DSB's recommendations and  rulings in this dispute.</p>
