          <div class="panel-body">
    	              <p>This dispute concerns Korea's imposition of import bans and  additional testing and certification requirements for radionuclide content  following the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident on Japan's  north-eastern coast on 11 March 2011. The measures affect imports of food  products from Japan. Korea responded to the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power  Plant accident in Japan, in 2011, by imposing a variety of import control  measures on Japanese products. The measures included import bans on specific  fishery products from certain Japanese prefectures (product-specific bans)  which were later extended to all fishery products from certain Japanese prefectures  (blanket import ban) and testing and certification requirements on certain  Japanese products. </p>
    	              <p>The initial product-specific import bans mirrored internal  restrictions imposed by Japan following the accident. However, as Japanese  authorities began to lift their own restrictions on certain products from  certain prefectures, the Korean ones remained. In this dispute, Japan  challenged the Korean product-specific bans imposed in 2012 on Pacific Cod from  5 prefectures in Japan: Aomori, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Iwate and Miyagi  prefectures, and on Alaska Pollock from Fukushima. </p>
    	              <p>In 2013, Korea also imposed a blanket import ban on all Japanese  fishery products from the following 8 prefectures: Aomori, Chiba, Fukushima,  Gunma, Ibaraki, Iwate, Miyagi, and Tochigi. Japan challenged this ban with  respect to 28 of its fishery products affected by this measure.</p>
    	              <p> Prior to the accident Korea imposed random at-the-border testing  for all imports for the presence of caesium or iodine within its tolerance  levels. Shortly after the accident in 2011, Korea imposed certain additional  testing requirements for Japanese products. These included requiring pre-export  caesium and iodine content certificates for products from certain prefectures,  testing all Japanese import consignments at-the-border for caesium and iodine,  and imposing a requirement for testing for additional radionuclides if trace  amounts of caesium or iodine were detected in non-fishery and livestock products.  The requirement to test for additional radionuclides (additional testing  requirements) was extended to fishery products in 2013. Of these measures,  Japan challenged before the Panel the additional testing requirements.</p>
    	              <p>Japan challenged Korea's import bans and additional testing  requirements as being inconsistent with provisions of the SPS Agreement  relative to: discrimination (Article 2.3), more trade restrictive than required  (Article 5.6), transparency (Article 7 and Annex B), and SPS approval  procedures (Article 8 and Annex C). Japan requested the Panel to find that, with  respect to the import bans and the additional testing requirements:</p>
    	              <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
    	                <li>Korea's blanket import ban on 28  fisheries products, and Korea's additional testing requirements, are  inconsistent with Articles 2.3 because they arbitrarily and unjustifiably  discriminate against Japanese products, and they constitute a disguised restriction  on international trade;</li>
    	                <li>Are inconsistent with Article 5.6  of the SPS Agreement as the measures are more trade restrictive than required;</li>
    	                <li>Korea failed to comply with the  transparency requirements in Article 7 and paragraphs 1 and 3 of Annex B to the  SPS Agreement as Korea's announcements of the imposition of these measures via  press releases posted on government websites was not sufficient to comply with  the obligation in Annex B(1) of the SPS Agreement, and that Korea's Enquiry  Point's responses to two requests for documents and answers from Japan did not  fulfil Korea's obligations under Annex B(3);</li>
    	                <li>Korea's additional testing  requirements are inconsistent with Article 8 and paragraphs 1(a), 1(c), 1(e)  and 1(g) of Annex C to the SPS Agreement. </li>
  	                </ol>
    	              <p>The Panel found&nbsp;that the measures at issue were SPS measures  within the meaning of Article 1.1 and Annex A(1)(b) of the SPS Agreement and determined  that Korea had not shown that these measures fall within the scope of Article  5.7 of the SPS Agreement. The Panel found that Japan had not demonstrated that  Korea acted inconsistently with its obligations under Article 8 and Annex C of  the SPS Agreement with respect to the adoption and maintenance of the 2011 and  2013 additional testing requirements. The Panel found that Korea's 2011  additional testing requirements and 2012 product-specific import bans were neither  discriminatory nor more trade-restrictive than required <strong>when adopted</strong>. However, the Panel found that the maintenance  of these measures as well as the adoption and maintenance of the 2013  additional testing requirements was inconsistent with Korea's obligations under  Articles 2.3 and 5.6 of the SPS Agreement. The Panel also found that Korea  failed to comply with its transparency obligations under Article 7 and Annex B  of the SPS Agreement with respect to the publication of all the measures and  the duties of its SPS Enquiry Point. Specifically, the Panel's findings were:</p>
    	              <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
    	                <li>Korea's 2011 additional testing  requirements and 2012 product-specific import bans were not more  trade-restrictive than required when adopted.</li>
    	                <li>At the time of the Panel's establishment  in September 2015, the 2011 additional testing requirements and 2012  product-specific import bans were maintained in a manner inconsistent with  Article 5.6 of the SPS Agreement because they were more trade-restrictive than  required.</li>
    	                <li>The 2013 additional testing  requirements were adopted and maintained in a manner inconsistent with Article  5.6 of the SPS Agreement because they were and are more trade-restrictive than  required.</li>
    	                <li>The blanket import ban (with  the exception of the ban on Pacific cod originating from Fukushima and Ibaraki)  was adopted in a manner inconsistent with Article 5.6 of the SPS Agreement  because it was more trade-restrictive than required.</li>
    	                <li>The maintenance of the blanket  import ban, with respect to all 28 fishery products from all 8 prefectures is  maintained in a manner inconsistent with Article 5.6 of the SPS Agreement because  it is more trade-restrictive than required.</li>
    	                <li>The 2013 additional testing  requirements and the blanket import ban with respect to the 27 fishery products  subject to Japan's claim from the 8 prefectures and Pacific cod from 6  prefectures, i.e. excluding Pacific cod from Fukushima and Ibaraki, were  inconsistent with Article 2.3, first sentence of the SPS Agreement and, as a  consequence, with Article 2.3, second sentence, when Korea adopted them.</li>
    	                <li>By maintaining the  product-specific and blanket import bans on the 28 fishery products from the 8  prefectures and the 2011 and 2013 additional testing requirements on Japanese  products, Korea acted inconsistently with Article 2.3, first sentence of the  SPS Agreement and, as a consequence with Article 2.3, second sentence.</li>
    	                <li>Japan failed to establish that  Korea acted inconsistently with the provisions of Annex C(1), subparagraphs  (a), (c), (e) and (g) and, as a consequence, with Article 8 of the SPS  Agreement with respect to the adoption and maintenance of the 2011 and the 2013  additional testing requirements.</li>
    	                <li>Korea acted inconsistently with  Annex B(1), and as a consequence Article 7 of the SPS Agreement, with respect  to the publication of all of the challenged measures.</li>
    	                <li>Korea's SPS Enquiry Point's  failure to respond at all to Japan's follow-up query in conjunction with its  earlier failure, is sufficient to establish that Korea acted inconsistently  with the obligation in Annex B(3) and as a consequence Article 7 of the SPS  Agreement.</li>

    	<p class="paranormaltext">On 9 April 2018, Korea notified the DSB of its  decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law and legal  interpretations in the panel report. On 16 April 2018, Japan notified the DSB  of its decision to cross-appeal.</p>
    	<p class="paranormaltext">On 8 June 2018, the Appellate Body informed the DSB that it  would not be able to circulate the Appellate Body report in this appeal by the  end of the 60-day period, nor within the 90-day time-frame provided for in  Article 17.5 of the DSU. The Appellate Body referred to the substantially  enhanced workload it faced in 2018, the existence of several appeals proceeding  in parallel, and the increasing overlap in the composition of the Divisions  hearing the different appeals owing to the vacancies on the Appellate Body. The  Appellate Body also referred to the scheduling issues arising from these  circumstances, the number and complexity of the issues raised in this and  concurrent appellate proceedings, together with the demands that these  concurrent appeals place on the WTO Secretariat's translation services, and the  shortage of staff in the Appellate Body Secretariat. On 1&nbsp;March  2019, the Appellate Body informed the DSB that it expected to circulate the  Appellate Body report in this appeal on 11 April 2019.</p>

    	    <p><strong>Article&nbsp;5.6 of the SPS&nbsp;Agreement: &ldquo;more  trade-restrictive than required&rdquo;</strong></p>
            <p>In relation to Korea's claim that the Panel erred in its application of Article&nbsp;5.6, Korea argued that the Panel disregarded Korea's  appropriate level of protection (ALOP) by assessing Japan's proposed  alternative measure against an incorrect standard. The Appellate Body noted that  the Panel accepted Korea's ALOP as one consisting of quantitative and  qualitative elements. To the Appellate Body, the Panel's analysis of the  alternative measure proposed by Japan effectively focused only on the  quantitative element of Korea's ALOP. The Appellate Body concluded that, having  identified all elements of Korea's ALOP, the Panel erred by not accounting for  all of these elements in its assessment under Article&nbsp;5.6. The Appellate  Body thus reversed the Panel's finding that Korea's measures were inconsistent  with Article 5.6 for being more trade-restrictive than required to achieve  Korea's ALOP.</p>
            <p><strong>Article 2.3 of the SPS&nbsp;Agreement: non-discrimination</strong></p>
            <p>In relation to Korea's challenge on appeal under Article&nbsp;2.3,  Korea argued, <em>inter alia</em>, that the  Panel erred in finding that &ldquo;similar conditions prevail&rdquo; in Japan and  other Members. To Korea, the Panel erroneously treated the risk present in <strong>products</strong> as the only relevant  &ldquo;condition&rdquo; under Article 2.3, to the exclusion of conditions in the <strong>territories</strong> of different Members. </p>
            <p>The Appellate Body found that the Panel erred in its  interpretation of Article 2.3 by considering that relevant  &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; under this provision may be exclusively limited to  &ldquo;the risk present in products&rdquo;, to the exclusion of other conditions,  including territorial conditions, that have the potential to affect the  products at issue. Regarding the Panel's application of Article&nbsp;2.3, the  Appellate Body considered that the Panel effectively relied on actual  contamination levels in food <strong>products</strong> without reconciling its findings as to pertinent <strong>territorial</strong> conditions affecting the potential for contamination of  food. To the Appellate Body, the analysis under Article&nbsp;2.3 entails  consideration of all relevant conditions in different Members, including  territorial conditions that may not yet have manifested in products but are  relevant in light of the regulatory objective and specific SPS risks at issue.  The Appellate Body thus reversed the Panel findings under Article&nbsp;2.3. In light of the  reversal, the Appellate Body did not consider it necessary to address Korea's  additional claims of error regarding arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination,  and whether Korea's measures constitute disguised restrictions on international  trade.</p>
            <p><strong>Article&nbsp;5.7 of the SPS&nbsp;Agreement: provisional  measures</strong></p>
            <p>In relation to Korea's claim that the Panel erred in finding that  Korea's measures do not fulfil the requirements of Article&nbsp;5.7, Korea  argued that these findings were outside the Panel's terms of reference. The  Appellate Body noted that, before the Panel, Japan had not made a claim of  inconsistency under Article 5.7. The Appellate Body also noted that Korea did  not invoke Article&nbsp;5.7 as a defence. Rather, Korea referred to this  provision as relevant <strong>context</strong> to the  Panel's assessment of Japan's claims under other provisions of the SPS  Agreement. Thus, the Appellate Body considered that, by making these findings  under Article 5.7, the Panel exceeded its mandate, thereby acting  inconsistently with Articles 7.1 and 11 of the DSU. For this reason, the Appellate  Body declared the Panel's findings under Article 5.7 moot and of no legal  effect.</p>
            <p><strong>Article&nbsp;7 and Annex&nbsp;B(1) to the  SPS&nbsp;Agreement: publication obligations</strong></p>
            <p>Korea claimed that the Panel erred in its interpretation of Annex B(1)  in finding that the publication of an SPS regulation must contain sufficient  content such that the interested Member will know &ldquo;the conditions  (including specific principles and methods) that apply to its goods&rdquo;. The  Appellate Body considered that Members must ensure that an Annex B(1)  publication be accessible to interested Members and contain sufficient  information, including the product scope and the requirements of the adopted  SPS regulation, to give the means to interested Members to become familiar with  that SPS&nbsp;regulation. The Appellate Body modified the Panel's finding and  found instead that whether an Annex B(1) publication needs to include the  &ldquo;specific principles and methods&rdquo; may only be determined with  reference to the specific circumstances of each case, such as the nature of the  SPS regulation at issue, the products covered, and the nature of the SPS risks  involved.</p>
            <p>In relation to Korea's claim that the Panel erred in applying Annex B(1)  to the blanket import ban, the Appellate Body agreed with the Panel that the  press release at issue did not include the full product coverage of the  measure. In relation to Korea's claim that the Panel erred in applying Annex  B(1) to the 2011 and 2013 additional testing requirements, the Appellate Body  agreed with the Panel that the press releases did not contain certain  requirements of the measures. In relation to Korea's claim that the Panel erred  in finding that Korea had not shown that interested Members would have known to  look to certain websites for information on the challenged measures, the  Appellate Body considered that, in light of the case presented by Japan, it was  for Korea to provide some evidence or explanation regarding this question.  Korea, however, had failed to do so. The Appellate Body thus upheld the Panel  findings at issue.</p>
            <p>Korea claimed that  the Panel erred under Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU in faulting Korea for not  having provided archived versions of the webpages containing the press releases  announcing the measures at  issue. The Appellate Body noted that the Panel did not address in its  analysis evidence on its record that could be indicative of the publication  dates of the press releases. To the extent the Panel needed evidence on the  publication dates of the press releases on websites, the Appellate Body  considered that Article 11 of the DSU required the Panel to seek such evidence  from both parties to the dispute and only then draw appropriate inferences. The  Appellate Body thus found that the Panel acted inconsistently with Article 11  of the DSU.</p>
            <p><strong>Article&nbsp;7 and Annex&nbsp;B(3) to the  SPS&nbsp;Agreement: SPS&nbsp;enquiry points</strong></p>
            <p>Korea claimed that  the Panel erred in its interpretation and application of Annex&nbsp;B(3) in  finding that Korea acted inconsistently with this provision because its SPS  enquiry point provided an incomplete response to one request for information by  Japan and failed to respond to another. The  Appellate Body considered that a single failure of an enquiry point to respond  would not automatically result in an inconsistency with Annex B(3). That  said, whether and the extent to which  an enquiry point actually provides answers and documents are not irrelevant for  an assessment under Annex B(3). To the Appellate Body, these elements inform an  assessment of whether &ldquo;one  enquiry point exists which is responsible for the provision of answers to all  reasonable questions from interested Members as well as for the provision of  relevant documents&rdquo; under Annex B(3). The Appellate Body thus reversed the  Panel findings at issue. </p>
            <p><strong>Annex&nbsp;C(1)(a) to the SPS&nbsp;Agreement: presumption  of likeness</strong></p>
            <p>Japan claimed that the Panel erred in its interpretation and application  of Annex C(1)(a) in articulating the conditions for presuming <strong>likeness</strong> under this provision and in  finding that Japanese products and Korean domestic products could not be  presumed to be &ldquo;like&rdquo;. The Panel accepted that, in principle,  likeness may be presumed for purposes of Annex&nbsp;C(1)(a), as it can  be done under the GATT 1994 and the GATS when a measure distinguishes between  products (or services and service suppliers) solely based on origin. The  Appellate Body was not convinced that the Panel could have done so under the  SPS&nbsp;Agreement without further analysis. Given that SPS&nbsp;measures are  defined in Annex&nbsp;A(1) as measures applied to protect human, animal, or  plant life or health or to prevent or limit certain damage, the question arises  whether a procedure under Annex&nbsp;C(1)(a) is at all capable of  distinguishing between products based exclusively on their origin. The  Appellate Body, however, considered that the Panel correctly concluded that the  measures in this case did not distinguish between products solely based on  origin. Upholding the Panel findings at issue, the Appellate Body found that  the Panel did not err in declining to presume that Japanese products and Korean  domestic products are &ldquo;like&rdquo;.</p>
            <p><strong>Panel's treatment of evidence and selection of experts</strong></p>
            <p>Both Korea and Japan claimed  on appeal that the Panel erred in its treatment of evidence when assessing  Korea's measures under Articles&nbsp;2.3 and 5.6 of the SPS&nbsp;Agreement.  Korea also claimed that the Panel acted inconsistently under Article&nbsp;11 of  the DSU by appointing two&nbsp;experts in disregard of Korea's due process rights. The  Panel had relied on these experts' responses in assessing Korea's measures  under Articles&nbsp;2.3, 5.6, and 5.7 of the SPS&nbsp;Agreement. Having  reversed the Panel's findings under Articles&nbsp;2.3 and 5.6, and having  declared the Panel's findings under Article&nbsp;5.7 moot and of no legal  effect, the Appellate Body did not consider it necessary to examine further  these claims of error on appeal.</p>
