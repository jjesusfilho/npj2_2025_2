        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Korea. </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 22 December 2014, Korea requested consultations with  the United States regarding certain anti&#8209;dumping measures on oil country  tubular goods (OCTG) from Korea and the investigation methodology underlying  such measures.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Korea claims that these are inconsistent with:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">Articles 2.2, 2.2.2, 2.2.1.1, 2.3, 2.4, 6.2,  6.4, 6.9, 6.10, including Articles 6.10.1 and 6.10.2, and 12.2.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement; and<br />
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">Articles I and X:3 of the GATT 1994.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 8  January 2015, Turkey requested  to join the consultations. On 14 January 2015, the Russian Federation requested to join the  consultations. On 15 January 2015, Ukraine requested to join the consultations.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 23 February 2015, Korea requested the  establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 10  March 2015, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> At its meeting on 25 March 2015, the DSB  established a panel. Canada, China, the  European Union, India, the Russian Federation and Turkey reserved their  third-party rights. Subsequently, Mexico reserved its third-party  rights.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 13 July 2015, the parties agreed on the composition  of the panel. On 16 January 2016, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that the beginning of the Panel's work had been delayed as a result of a lack of available experienced lawyers in the Secretariat. The panel thus expected to issue its final report to the parties before the end of 2016.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 15 September 2016, following the resignation of the  Chair of the panel, the parties agreed on a new Chair.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 19 December 2016, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that following an additional delay as a result of the need to appoint a new Chair of the panel and due to the complexity of the issues raised by the parties in this dispute, the panel expected to issue its final report to the parties by June 2017. </p>

      <p class="paranormaltext" id="bkmk488r"><a  name="bkmk488r"></a>On 14 November 2017, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
    	                <p>This dispute concerned anti-dumping measures imposed by the United  States on oil country tubular goods (OCTG) imported from Korea following an investigation by the  United States Department of Commerce (USDOC), as well as the WTO-consistency of  certain provisions of US anti-dumping law. In making its findings, with respect  to the anti-dumping measures on OCTG, the Panel limited its review to the  original determination of the USDOC, finding a new determination of the USDOC  in this regard, which was challenged by Korea, but issued after panel  establishment, to be outside its terms of reference. The Panel also found  aspects of several claims made by Korea to be outside its terms of reference,  and rejected them. </p>
    	    <p><strong>WTO-consistency  of US laws on normal value calculation</strong></p>
    	                <p>Korea claimed that US domestic  regulation (viability test), which prohibited the USDOC from using  third-country market sales as a basis for determining normal value unless  certain conditions were met, was &ldquo;as such&rdquo; inconsistent with Article  2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. Korea also claimed that the USDOC's  application of the viability test in the OCTG investigation was inconsistent  with Article 2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. The Panel rejected Korea's  claims, finding that Article 2.2 does not preclude an investigating authority  from establishing its own criteria for choosing between the use of  third-country sales and constructed normal value for the determination of  normal value. </p>
    	    <p><strong>Profit determination </strong></p>
    	                <p>Korea claimed that the USDOC's failure to use actual data of the  Korean respondents to determine their constructed value (CV) profit rate, even  though their actual home market and third-country market profit data was  available on the record of the investigation, was inconsistent with the <em>chapeau </em>of Article 2.2.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement. The Panel upheld Korea's claim that the USDOC failed to  determine CV profit using the respondents' actual data pertaining to home  market sales, finding that the USDOC had no basis for not using data pertaining  to those sales as a basis for determining CV profit. Having concluded that the  USDOC had no basis to reject the actual data pertaining to domestic sales of  the like product, the Panel did not find it necessary to resolve the question  whether the USDOC should have determined CV profit on the basis of the profit  derived by the Korean respondents from third-country markets in order to comply  with the chapeau of Article 2.2.2 and, therefore, exercised judicial economy on  that claim. </p>
    	                <p>Korea claimed that the USDOC's reliance on an impermissibly narrow  definition of the &ldquo;same general category of products&rdquo; in concluding  that it could not determine CV profit under Article 2.2.2(i), and in concluding  that it could not calculate the profit cap required by Article 2.2.2(iii), was  inconsistent with Articles 2.2.2(i) and (iii) of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.  The Panel upheld Korea's claim, finding that the USDOC defined the same general  category of products more narrowly than the like product by excluding from that  definition, OCTG not used for down hole applications, which was part of the  like product as defined by the USDOC. The USDOC, therefore, had no proper basis  for its conclusions that it could not determine CV profit under Article  2.2.2(i) and calculate the profit cap required by Article 2.2.2(iii). </p>
    	                <p>Korea claimed that the USDOC acted inconsistently with Article  2.2.2(iii) of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because the USDOC failed to calculate  and apply a profit cap as required by that provision, and as a consequence,  acted inconsistently with Article 2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement by failing  to use a reasonable amount for profits in the construction of normal value for  the Korean respondents. The Panel agreed with Korea, concluding that the USDOC  acted inconsistently with Article 2.2.2(iii) because it had failed to calculate  and apply a profit cap, which is mandatory under that provision. The Panel  further considered that the USDOC's determination that no profit data  pertaining to the same general category of products was available could not  justify that failure because the USDOC had erroneously defined the same general  category of products. The Panel also concluded that in the absence of a profit  cap, the profit that the USDOC determined was not a &ldquo;reasonable  amount&rdquo; within the meaning of Article 2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </p>
    	    <p><strong>Construction of export price</strong></p>
    	                <p>Korea claimed that the USDOC acted  inconsistently with Article 2.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because it  constructed the export price of an exporter, without properly considering  whether the export price was unreliable because of association between the  exporter and the importer or a third party. The Panel found that Korea had not shown that the USDOC's conclusions on association were improper, or that it had erred in not considering evidence regarding the reliability of the export price.</p>
    	    <p><strong>Cost calculations</strong></p>
    	                <p>Korea claimed that the USDOC acted  inconsistently with Article 2.2.1.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because it  rejected the price paid by an exporter for certain steel coils, an input used  in the production of OCTG, on the ground that this exporter had an association  with its steel coils supplier. Korea argued that the USDOC's conclusion  regarding affiliation was improper, but the Panel rejected this argument. The  Panel focused on whether the rejection of this price was done in accordance  with the second sentence of Article 2.2.1.1. The Panel found that it was,  considering the USDOC had properly found association between the exporter and  its supplier, and then conducted an arm's length test to consider the  reliability of the purchase prices of steel coils. The Panel found that Korea  had not shown why this type of enquiry was not permitted under Article 2.2.1.1,  or how the USDOC had acted inconsistently with this provision, and rejected  Korea's claim.</p>
    	    <p><strong>Procedural claims challenging the  conduct of the USDOC</strong></p>
    	                <p>Korea claimed that the USDOC's failure to notify the Korean  respondents, until its final determination, that it had accepted the Tenaris  financial statements on the record was inconsistent with Article 6.2 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement. The Panel rejected Korea's claim, finding that Korea  had not demonstrated that the absence of a notification from the USDOC, until  its final determination, that it had accepted the Tenaris financial statements  on the record prevented the Korean respondents from launching a full scale  argument and submitting rebuttal facts. </p>
    	                <p>Korea claimed that the USDOC's failure to notify the Korean  respondents, until its final determination, that it had accepted the Tenaris  financial statements on the record and that it was using these statements in  determining CV profit was inconsistent with Article 6.4 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement. The Panel rejected this claim, finding that Korea had not  established that the USDOC, in not notifying the Korean respondents, until its  final determination that it had accepted the Tenaris financial statements on  the record, and that it was using that data for determining CV profit, had  acted inconsistently with Article 6.4. </p>
    	                <p>Korea claimed that the USDOC's failure to disclose that it had  accepted the Tenaris financial statements on the record and that it had relied  on those statements in determining CV profit was inconsistent with Article 6.9  of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. The Panel disagreed with Korea, finding that  neither the USDOC's decision to accept the Tenaris financial statements on the  record, nor its reliance on those statements to calculate CV profit, could be  understood to constitute essential facts within the meaning of Article 6.9, and  the USDOC was therefore under no obligation to disclose them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    	    <p><strong>Claims regarding the USDOC's  decision to not individually examine all exporters</strong></p>
    	                <p>Korea claimed that the USDOC  acted inconsistently with Article 6.10 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement in  connection with its conclusion that and explanation why it would be  impracticable to examine all the known exporters, and why it was limiting its  examination to two exporters. Korea also claimed that the USDOC acted  inconsistently with Article 6.10.2 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement in connection with its conclusion that and explanation why it would  be unduly burdensome to individually examine voluntary respondents. The Panel  rejected both claims on the ground that Korea had not shown an error in the  conclusions reached by the USDOC in this regard.</p>
    	    <p><strong>Public  notice</strong></p>
    	                <p>Korea claimed that the USDOC acted inconsistently with Articles  12.2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because it failed to give reason for the  rejection of several relevant arguments made by the exporters in the underlying  investigation. The Panel rejected these claims, albeit on different grounds.  With respect to certain claims, the Panel found that Korea had failed to  demonstrate a violation of Article 12.2.2 as the USDOC's explanation made it  clear how the arguments were rejected, whereas with respect to others, the  Panel found that Korea had not shown why the concerned arguments were relevant,  or had otherwise failed to make a <em>prima  facie</em> case of violation.</p>
    	    <p><strong>Administration  of US laws in the OCTG investigation</strong></p>
    	                <p>Korea claimed that the USDOC acted inconsistently with Article X.3  (a) of the GATT 1994, as it failed to administer its laws and regulations in a  uniform and reasonable manner, alleging in particular that certain procedural  laws were differently applied in the underlying investigation from certain  parallel investigations on OCTG. The Panel rejected these claims, finding that  Korea had not shown that such a differential treatment was, in fact, made, and  thus not established the factual basis of its claim. The Panel also rejected,  on the same grounds, Korea's claim under Article I.1 of the GATT 1994, that  arose from the same factual basis as its claim under Article X.3(a) of the GATT  1994. </p>
    	    <p>The Panel exercised judicial economy with  respect to a number of claims, including consequential claims raised by Korea  under Articles 1 and 9.3 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. </p>
    	    <p>However, the Panel rejected Korea's consequential  claim under Article 18.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, as it depended on a  finding that the United States' &ldquo;viability test&rdquo; was inconsistent  with Article 2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. The Panel also rejected Korea's  consequential claim under Article VI of the GATT 1994, as Korea did not  identify which specific aspect of this provision had been violated, and under  Article XVI.4 of the WTO Agreement, as it depended on a violation under Article  VI of the GATT 1994.</p>

    	      At the DSB  meeting on 9 February 2018, the United States informed the DSB of its intention  to implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings and that it would need a  reasonable period of time to do so.</p>
    	    <p> On 26 February  2018, Korea and the United States informed the DSB they had agreed that the  reasonable period of time to implement the DSB's recommendations and rulings  would be 12&nbsp;months. Accordingly, the reasonable period of time was set to  expire on 12 January 2019. On 11  January 2019, Korea and the United States informed the DSB they had agreed to  modify the previously notified reasonable period of time, which was set to  expire on 12 July 2019.</p>
    	    <p>On 6 February 2020, the United States  and Korea informed the DSB of Agreed Procedures under Articles 21 and 22 of the  DSU (sequencing agreement). The parties thus agreed not to appeal the report of  a compliance panel established pursuant to Article 21.5 of the DSU, and that  were the parties to agree on arbitration procedures under Article 25 of the DSU  to provide for review of the report of the compliance panel, they would amend  the agreement accordingly.</p>
    	    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    	    <h3>Proceedings under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
            <p>On 29 July 2019, Korea requested the  authorization of the DSB to suspend concessions or other obligations pursuant  to Article 22.2 of the DSU on the grounds that the United States had failed to  comply with the DSB's recommendations and rulings within the reasonable period  of time. On  8&nbsp;August&nbsp;2019, the United States objected to Korea's proposed level  of suspension of concessions pursuant to Article 22.6 of the DSU.</p>
            <p>At the DSB meeting on 9 August 2019, the  Chair of the DSB took note that the matter raised by the United States had been  referred to arbitration pursuant to Article 22.6 of the DSU.</p>
