		<h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Korea. </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 13 June 2000, Korea requested
      consultations with the United States in respect of the definitive
      safeguard measure imposed by the United States on imports of circular
      welded carbon quality line pipe (line pipe). Korea noted that on 18
      February 2000 the United States proclaimed a definitive safeguard measure
      on imports of line pipe (subheadings 7306.10.10 and 7306.10.50 of the
      Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States). In that proclamation,
      the United States announced that the proposed date of introduction of the
      measure was 1 March 2000 and that the measure was expected to remain in
      effect for 3 years and 1 day. Korea considered that the US procedures and
      determinations that led to the imposition of the safeguard measure as well
      as the measure itself contravened various provisions contained in the
      Safeguards Agreement and the GATT 1994. In particular, Korea considers
      that the measure is inconsistent with the United States’ obligations under
      Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 11 and 12 of the Safeguards Agreement; and Articles
      I, XIII and XIX of the GATT 1994.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext">Further to Korea’s request, the DSB established a panel
      at its meeting of 23 October 2000. Australia, Canada, EC, Japan and Mexico
      reserved their third-party rights. On 12 January 2001, Korea requested the
      Director-General to determine the composition of the Panel. On 22 January
      2001, the Panel was composed.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 29 October 2001, the Panel circulated its report to
      the Members. The Panel concluded that the US line pipe measure was imposed
      inconsistently with certain provisions of GATT 1994 and/or the Safeguards
      Agreement, in particular:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>the line pipe measure is not consistent with the
      general rule contained in the chapeau of Article XIII:2 because it has
      been applied without respecting traditional trade patterns;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the line pipe measure is not consistent with Article
      XIII2:(a) because it has been applied without fixing the total amount of
      imports permitted at the lower tariff rate;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the US acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and
      4.2(c) by failing to include in its published report a finding or reasoned
      conclusion either (i) that increased imports have caused serious injury,
      or (ii) that increased imports are threatening to cause serious injury;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the US acted inconsistently with Article 4.2(b) by
      failing to establish a causal link between the increased imports and the
      serious injury, or threat thereof;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the US has not complied with its obligations under
      Article 9.1 by applying the measure to developing countries whose imports
      do not exceed the individual and collective thresholds in that provision;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the US acted inconsistently with its obligations under
      Article XIX by failing to demonstrate the existence of unforeseen
      developments prior to the application of the line pipe measure;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the US has acted inconsistently with its obligations
      under Article 12.3 by failing to provide an adequate opportunity for prior
      consultations with Members having a substantial interest as exporters of
      line pipe;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>the US has acted inconsistently with its obligations
      under Article 8.1 to endeavour to maintain a substantially equivalent
      level of concessions and other obligations;</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">All other claims by Korea were rejected by the Panel.
      The Panel also declined Korea’s request for the Panel to find that the US
      safeguard measure should be lifted immediately and the ITC safeguard
      investigation on line pipe terminated.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 6 November 2001, the US notified its decision to
      appeal certain findings of law and legal interpretations contained in the
      Panel Report. However, on 13 November 2001, it withdrew its notice of
      appeal. Later, on 19 November 2001, the US notified its decision to
      re-file its appeal to the Appellate Body. On 18 January 2002, the
      Appellate Body informed the DSB that there would be a delay in the
      circulation of the report. Accordingly, the Appellate Body informed that
      the report would be circulated to the Members no later than 15 February
      2002. On 15 February 2002, the Appellate Body circulated its report to the
      Members. The Appellate Body:</p>
      <ul class="paranormaltext">
        <li>upheld, albeit for different reasons, the Panel’s
      finding, in paragraph 8.1(7) of the Panel Report, that the United States
      acted inconsistently with its obligation under Article 12.3 of the <i>Agreement
      on Safeguards</i> by failing to provide an adequate opportunity for prior
      consultations with Korea, a Member having a substantial interest in
      exports of line pipe;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>upheld the Panel’s finding, in paragraph 8.1(8) of the
      Panel Report, that the United States acted inconsistently with its
      obligation under Article 8.1 of the <i>Agreement on Safeguards</i> to
      endeavour to maintain a substantially equivalent level of concessions and
      other obligations;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>upheld the Panel’s finding, in paragraph 8.1(5) of the
      Panel Report, that the United States did not comply with its obligation
      under Article 9.1 of the <i>Agreement on Safeguards</i> that safeguard
      measures shall not be applied against a product originating in a
      developing country Member as long as its imports do not exceed the
      individual and collective thresholds in that provision;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>reversed the Panel’s finding, in paragraph 8.1(3) of
      the Panel Report, that the United States acted inconsistently with its
      obligations under Articles 3.1 and 4.2(c) of the <i>Agreement on
      Safeguards</i> by failing to include in its published report a finding or
      reasoned conclusion either (1) that increased imports have caused serious
      injury, or (2) that increased imports are threatening to cause serious
      injury;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>reversed the Panel’s finding, in paragraph 8.2(9) of
      the Panel Report, that the United States did not violate its obligations
      under Articles 2 and 4 of the <i>Agreement on Safeguards </i>by exempting
      Canada and Mexico from the line pipe measure;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>modified the Panel’s finding, in paragraph 8.2(1)) of
      the Panel Report, that the United States did not violate its obligations
      under Articles I, XIII:1 and XIX of GATT 1994 by exempting Canada and
      Mexico from the line pipe measures, declaring it moot and as having no
      legal effect;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>upheld the Panel’s finding, in paragraph 8.1(4) of the
      Panel Report, that the United States acted inconsistently with its
      obligation under Article 4.2(b) of the <i>Agreement on Safeguards</i> by
      failing to establish a causal link between the increased imports and the
      serious injury or threat thereof;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>upheld the Panel’s finding, in paragraph 7.81 of the
      Panel Report, that the United States was not required by Article 5.1,
      first sentence, of the <i>Agreement on Safeguards</i> to demonstrate, at
      the time of imposition, that the line pipe measure was necessary to
      prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment;<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>reversed the Panel’s finding, in paragraph 8.2(2) of
      the Panel Report, that Korea failed to make a <i>prima facie </i>case that
      the United States violated its obligation under Article 5.1, first
      sentence, of the <i>Agreement on Safeguards</i>, by imposing a measure
      that exceeds what is “necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury
      and to facilitate adjustment”, and finds that the United States
      applied the line pipe measure beyond the “extent necessary to prevent
      or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment”.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 8 March 2002, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body
      Report and the Panel Report, as modified by the Appellate Body Report.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Implementation  of adopted reports</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"> At the DSB meeting on 5 April 2002,
      the US expressed its intention to implement the DSB’s recommendations and
      indicated that it would enter into consultations with Korea to determine a
      reasonable period of time for implementation. At the DSB meeting on 17
      April 2002, Korea expressed concern about the lack of any proposal from
      the US regarding a reasonable period of time for compliance. The US stated
      that they would be proposing a reasonable period of time as soon as
      possible. On 29 April 2002, Korea requested the DSB that the “reasonable period of time” be determined by binding arbitration
      pursuant to Article 21.3(c) of the DSU. On 13 May 2002, Korea requested
      the Director-General to appoint an arbitrator. On 23 May 2002, the
      Director-General appointed an arbitrator. The issuance of the award was
      scheduled for 12 July 2002. By joint letter of 12 July 2002, the parties
      requested the Arbitrator to delay the issuance of the award until 22 July
      2002 in order to allow time for additional bilateral negotiations between
      the parties. The arbitrator acceded to the request. Additional joint
      requests for delay were received on 19 and 22 July 2002, wherein the
      parties requested that the award, pursuant to Article 21.3(c) of the DSU,
      be delayed until 24 July 2002 and 26 July 2002, respectively. The
      Arbitrator agreed also to these additional requests. By letters dated 24
      July 2002, the parties informed the Arbitrator that they had reached
      agreement on the reasonable period of time for compliance in this matter.
      Accordingly, the Arbitrator did not issue his award and, instead, issued a
      Report setting out the procedural history of this arbitration. On 29   July 2002, Korea and the United States notified the DSB that they had agreed that the  reasonable period of time to implement the DSB recommendations and ruling would  expire on 1&nbsp;September 2002.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Withdrawal/termination</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext">At the DSB meeting on 18 March 2003, theUS
      informed that its safeguard measure on line pipe from Korea had been
      terminated on 1 March 2003.
