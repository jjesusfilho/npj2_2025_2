        <h3>Consultations</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Indonesia.&nbsp;  </strong></p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 7 April 2010, Indonesia  requested consultations with the United States with respect to a  provision of the   Family Smoking  Prevention Tobacco Control Act of 2009 that bans clove cigarettes. &nbsp; Indonesia alleged that Section 907, which was signed into law  on 22 June 2009,  prohibits, among other things, the production or sale in the United States  of cigarettes containing certain additives, including clove, but would continue  to permit the production and sale of other cigarettes, including cigarettes  containing menthol. &nbsp; Indonesia alleged that Section 907  is inconsistent, inter alia, with Article III:4 of the GATT  1994, Article 2 of the TBT &nbsp;Agreement,  and various provisions of the SPS &nbsp;Agreement.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 9 June 2010, Indonesia requested the establishment of a panel.&nbsp; At its meeting on 22 June 2010, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
      <p class="paranormaltext">At  its meeting on 20 July 2010,  the DSB established a panel. Brazil,  the European Union, Guatemala,  Norway  and Turkey  reserved their third-party rights. &nbsp;Subsequently, Colombia, the Dominican Republic  and Mexico  reserved their third-party rights.  On 9 September 2010, the  parties agreed on the composition of the panel. On 8 March 2011, the Chairman of the panel informed the DSB  that the timetable adopted by the panel after consultations with the parties to  the dispute envisages that the final report  was to be  issued to the parties by the end of June 2011 and that the  panel  expected to conclude  its work within that timeframe.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><a name="bkmk406r" id="bkmk406r"></a>On 2 September 2011, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

      </div>
      <div aria-labelledby="headingOne" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseA" role="tabpanel">
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p class="paranormaltext">This dispute concerns Section&nbsp;907(a)(1)(A)  of the <em>Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic  Act</em> (&ldquo;FFDCA&rdquo;), which was added to the FFDCA by  Section&nbsp;101(b) of the <em>Family Smoking  Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</em>.&nbsp; This measure bans the production and sale of  clove cigarettes, as well as most other flavoured cigarettes, in the United  States.&nbsp; However, the measure excludes  menthol-flavoured cigarettes from the ban.&nbsp;  Indonesia is the world's main producer of clove cigarettes, and the vast  majority of clove cigarettes consumed in the United States prior to the ban  were imported from Indonesia. </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">Indonesia's main claims were that the ban on clove  cigarettes is discriminatory, and that it is also unnecessary.&nbsp; Indonesia further claimed that the United  States acted inconsistently with a number of procedural and/or other  requirements under the TBT Agreement in the context of preparing and implementing  Section 907(a)(1)(A).&nbsp; Indonesia did not  argue its claims under the SPS Agreement.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The first step in the Panel's analysis was to  determine whether the challenged measure falls within the scope of the TBT  Agreement.&nbsp; The Panel found that it does,  on the basis that Section 907(a)(1)(A) is a &ldquo;technical regulation&rdquo;  within the meaning of Annex 1.1 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement.&nbsp; The Panel then examined  Indonesia's claims under Articles&nbsp;2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.12, and  12.3 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">In one of its key  findings, the Panel found that the ban is inconsistent with the national  treatment obligation in Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement because it accords  clove cigarettes less favourable treatment than that accorded to menthol-flavoured  cigarettes.&nbsp; The Panel found that clove  and menthol-flavoured cigarettes are &ldquo;like products&rdquo; within the  meaning of Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement, based in part on its factual  findings that both types of cigarettes are flavoured and appeal to youth. Having  found a violation of Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement, the Panel declined to  rule on Indonesia's claim under Article III:4 of the GATT 1994, or on the  United States' defence under Article XX(b) of the GATT 1994 (invoked only in  respect of the claim under Article III:4 of the GATT 1994). </p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">However, the Panel rejected  Indonesia's second main claim, which was that the ban is unnecessary.&nbsp; In this regard, the Panel found that  Indonesia had failed to demonstrate that the ban is more trade-restrictive than  necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective (in this case, reducing youth  smoking) within the meaning of Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement.&nbsp; The Panel's conclusion was based, in part, on  its finding that there is extensive scientific evidence supporting the  conclusion that banning clove and other flavoured cigarettes could contribute  to reducing youth smoking.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">As regards Indonesia's  other claims under the TBT Agreement, the Panel found that the United States acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;2.9.2 (obligation  to notify WTO Members of technical regulations) and Article&nbsp;2.12  (obligation to allow reasonable interval between publication and entry into  force of technical regulations).&nbsp; However,  the Panel found that Indonesia  failed to demonstrate  that the United&nbsp;States  acted inconsistently with Article 2.5 (obligation to provide an explanation of  draft technical regulation), Article 2.8 (obligation to specify a technical  regulation in terms of performance), Article 2.9.3 (obligation to provide  particulars or copies of the proposed technical regulation) or Article 12.3  (obligation to take account of the special development,  financial and trade needs of a developing country Member), and declined to rule on Indonesia's claim under  Article 2.10 (obligation to notify in cases of urgency). </p></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 15 September 2011, Indonesia and the United States requested the DSB to adopt a draft decision extending the 60-day time period stipulated in Article 16.4 of the DSU, to 20 January 2012. At its meeting on 27 September 2011, the DSB  agreed that, upon a request by Indonesia or the United&nbsp;States, the DSB,  shall no later than 20 January 2012, adopt the panel report, unless the DSB  decides by consensus not to do so or Indonesia or the United States notifies  the DSB of its decision to appeal pursuant to Article 16.4 of the DSU.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 5 January 2012, the United States notified the  DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered  in the panel report and certain legal  interpretations developed by the panel. On 29 February 2012, the Chair of the Appellate  Body informed the DSB that the  Appellate Body would not be able to circulate its  report within 60 days due to the time required for completion and translation  of the report. &nbsp;The  Appellate Body estimated that the report would be circulated no  later than 4 April 2012.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext"><a name="bkmk406abr" id="bkmk406abr"></a>On 4  April 2012, the Appellate Body report was circulated to Members. </p>

      <div aria-labelledby="headingTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseB" role="tabpanel">
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p class="paranormaltext">Section&nbsp;907(a)(1)(A)  of the United States Federal Food, Drug,  and Cosmetic Act (&ldquo;FFDCA&rdquo;) prohibits the production and sale in  the United States of cigarettes with characterizing flavours (such as clove,  strawberry, grape, orange, cinnamon, pineapple, vanilla, coconut, liquorice,  cocoa, chocolate, cherry, or coffee), but does not prohibit regular or menthol  cigarettes.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The Panel in  this dispute found Section&nbsp;907(a)(1)(A) to be inconsistent with the  national treatment obligation of Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement because it prohibits imported clove cigarettes from  Indonesia, but does not prohibit &ldquo;like&rdquo; domestic menthol  cigarettes.&nbsp; The Panel also found that by  allowing an interval of less than six months between the publication and the  entry into force of Section&nbsp;907(a)(1)(A), the United States acted  inconsistently with Article 12.2 of the TBT  Agreement.&nbsp; On appeal the United  States claimed that the Panel erred in finding that clove and menthol cigarettes  are like products and in finding that Section&nbsp;907(a)(1)(A) accords less  favourable treatment to imported clove cigarettes than that accorded to like domestic  products within the meaning of Article&nbsp;2.1 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement.&nbsp; The  United States also claimed that the Panel erred in finding that the United  States acted inconsistently with Article 2.12 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext"> The Appellate Body ultimately  upheld the Panel's findings that Section&nbsp;907(a)(1)(A) is inconsistent with  Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement and  that the United States acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;2.12 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement.&nbsp; The Appellate Body, however, disagreed with  the Panel's interpretation of &ldquo;like products&rdquo; and &ldquo;treatment no  less favourable&rdquo; in Article 2.1 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body disagreed  with the Panel that &ldquo;like products&rdquo; in Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement should be interpreted based  on the regulatory purpose of the technical regulation at issue.&nbsp; The Appellate Body considered that the  determination of whether products are &ldquo;like&rdquo; within the meaning of  Article 2.1 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement is a determination about the competitive relationship between the products,  based on an analysis of the traditional &ldquo;likeness&rdquo; criteria, namely,  physical characteristics, end-uses, consumer tastes and habits, and tariff  classification.&nbsp; The Appellate Body  considered that the regulatory concerns underlying a measure, such as the  health risks associated with a product, may be relevant to the determination of  &ldquo;likeness&rdquo; to the extent they have an impact on the competitive  relationship between the products.&nbsp; Based  on this interpretation of the concept of &ldquo;like products&rdquo;, the  Appellate Body agreed with the Panel that clove cigarettes and menthol  cigarettes are &ldquo;like products&rdquo; within the meaning of Article&nbsp;2.1  of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">The Appellate Body interpreted  the obligation to accord &ldquo;treatment no less favourable&rdquo; in Article  2.1 of the TBT Agreement as not  prohibiting detrimental impact on imports that stems exclusively from a  legitimate regulatory distinction.&nbsp; In determining  whether a measure's detrimental impact on imports constitutes less favourable  treatment a panel must carefully scrutinize the particular circumstances of the  case, that is, the design, architecture, revealing structure, operation, and  application of the technical regulation at issue, and, in particular, whether  that technical regulation is even handed.&nbsp;  Based on this interpretation of &ldquo;treatment no less  favourable&rdquo;, the Appellate Body found that the design, architecture,  revealing structure, operation, and application of Section 907(a)(1)(A)  strongly suggest that the detrimental impact on competitive opportunities for  clove cigarettes reflects discrimination against the group of like products  imported from Indonesia.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext">Finally the Appellate Body  upheld the Panel's finding that by allowing only three months between the  publication and the entry into force of Section&nbsp;907(a)(1)(A), the United  States acted inconsistently with Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement, which, when interpreted in the context of paragraph  5.2 of the Doha Ministerial Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and  Concerns, requires a minimum of six months between the publication and the  entry into force of a technical regulation.&nbsp;  In reaching this conclusion, the Appellate Body agreed with the Panel  that paragraph 5.2 of the Doha Ministerial Decision constitutes a  &ldquo;subsequent agreement between the parties&rdquo; within the meaning of  Article&nbsp;31(3)(a) of the Vienna  Convention on the Law of Treaties.</p></div>

<p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on  24 April 2012, the DSB adopted the  Appellate Body report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body  report.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reasonable period of time</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext">At the DSB meeting on 24 May 2012, the United States  informed the DSB of its intention to  implement the DSB recommendations and rulings in a manner that protects public  health and respects its WTO obligations but that  it would need  a reasonable period of time to do so. On 14 June 2012, Indonesia and the United States  informed the DSB that the reasonable period of time for the United&nbsp;States  to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings shall be 15 months. &nbsp;Accordingly, the reasonable period of time  expired on 24 July 2013.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Proceedings under Article 22 of the DSU (remedies)</h3>
<p class="paranormaltext"> On 12 August 2013, Indonesia requested the  authorization of the DSB to suspend concessions or other obligations pursuant  to Article 22.2 of the DSU. On 22 August 2013, the  United States objected to the level of suspension of concessions or other  obligations and referred the matter to arbitration pursuant to Article 22.6 of  the DSU. At the DSB meeting on 23 August 2013, it  was agreed that the matter is referred to arbitration as required by Article  22.6 of the DSU.&nbsp; On 23 June 2014, Indonesia and the United States  requested the Arbitrator to suspend the circulation of the Arbitrator's award in  accordance to certain conditions. On 24 June 2014, the  Arbitrator informed the DSB that it had granted the parties' joint request to  suspend the circulation of  its decision in accordance with the parties' conditions.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 3 October 2014, Indonesia and the United States  notified the DSB that they  had reached a mutually agreed solution. In light of the  mutually agreed solution, Indonesia withdrew its  request, pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU, to  the DSB for authorizaton to suspend concessions or other obligations. As  Indonesia had withdrawn its request under Article 22.2 of the DSU, the  United States withdrew its objection to that request. On 8  October 2014, the Chair of the Arbitrator notified the DSB that  as it was not necessary to  issue a decision on this matter, the Arbitrator considered it had  completed its work.</p>
