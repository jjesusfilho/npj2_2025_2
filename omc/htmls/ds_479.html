    	    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The European Union challenges the imposition, by  the Russian Federation, of anti-dumping duties on certain light commercial  vehicles (LCVs) from Germany and Italy.&nbsp;  The measure at issue is Decision No. 113 of 14 May 2013 of the Board of the  Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC), including annexes, notices and reports of  the Department for Internal Market Defence of the EEC (DIMD) and any  amendments. <br>
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>At  issue is the DIMD's definition of the domestic industry, the DIMD's selection  of investigation periods, and the DIMD's determinations on price suppressive  effects, injury and causation.&nbsp; The European  Union also challenges certain procedural aspects of the underlying  investigation concerning confidential treatment of information, provision of non-confidential  summaries of information treated as confidential, and the disclosure of  essential facts.<br>
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>The  Russian Federation requested that the Panel reject the European Union's claims in this dispute in their  entirety.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Claims  concerning  the definition of the domestic industry</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The European Union claimed that the DIMD did  not conduct an objective examination based on positive evidence.&nbsp; This is because it defined the domestic industry as consisting of one producer, Sollers,  which accounted for about 87.8% of total domestic production of the like  product during the POI and excluded a known producer, GAZ, from the definition  of the domestic industry. The exclusion of GAZ from the domestic  industry led to a risk of materially distorting the injury analysis and  resulted in the violation of Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 4.1.<br>
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>The Panel found that the DIMD defined the domestic industry as Sollers only after it  received Questionnaire responses from both Sollers and GAZ. In this way, the  DIMD risked materially distorting its own injury analysis and therefore acted  inconsistently with Article&nbsp;4.1. Because the DIMD made its injury and  causation determinations on the basis of information related to an improperly  defined domestic industry, the DIMD also acted inconsistently with Article 3.1,  as a consequence of its breach of Article 4.1.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Claims  concerning the selection of periods of investigation</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The  European Union claimed that by  selecting &ldquo;non-consecutive periods of non-equal duration&rdquo; for the  examination of the trends for  the domestic industry, the DIMD's injury determination was not based on an  objective examination of positive evidence, contrary to Article&nbsp;3.1 of the  Anti&#8209;Dumping Agreement. In the  light of the alleged breach of Article&nbsp;3.1, the European Union also made consequential  claims under Articles&nbsp;3.2, 3.4, and 3.5. <br>
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>The Panel found that the DIMD did not compare or contrast half-year data with full  calendar year data, nor did the approach of DIMD of splitting the investigation  period have the intent or the effect of &ldquo;artificially creating&rdquo; negative trends. The Panel found that the European  Union's argument that the DIMD accepted the periods of investigation proposed  by the Applicant is not supported by the record. Furthermore, the European  Union had not established that the DIMD failed to explain its selection of the  periods. For those reasons, the Panel concluded that the European Union had  failed to establish that the DIMD acted inconsistently with Article&nbsp;3.1 by the alleged use of  &ldquo;non-equal and non&#8209;consecutive&rdquo; period in its injury and causation analyses.&nbsp; </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Claims concerning price suppressive  effects</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The European Union claimed that the DIMD acted  inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.2 by failing to make an objective  examination of the price suppressive effect of dumped imports based on positive  evidence.<br>
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>The  Panel found that the DIMD acted inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.2  by failing to taken into account the impact of the financial crisis in  determining the appropriate rate of return in its consideration of price  suppression. However, the European Union did not establish that the DIMD  acted inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.2 because the DIMD &ldquo;mixed up&rdquo; data expressed in USD and RUB without any explanation in  its consideration of price suppression.  In addition, the European Union did not establish that the trends in dumped  import prices and domestic prices called  into question the &ldquo;explanatory force&rdquo; of dumped imports for price suppression, that the DIMD should  have analysed whether the market would accept additional domestic price  increases, that the DIMD failed to examine whether any price suppression was the effect  of competitive pressure exerted by the other domestic producer, that the DIMD failed to  examine the relevance of the 2009 increase in customs duties on imported LCVs  from 10% to 25%, and that the DIMD  did not demonstrate that the alleged price suppression was &ldquo;to a  significant degree&rdquo;.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Claims concerning the state of the domestic  industry</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The European  Union claimed that the DIMD's examination of the impact of the dumped imports on the  state of the domestic industry does not constitute an objective examination  based on positive evidence.<br>
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>The  Panel found that the European Union did not demonstrate in what way the identified discrepancy brought into  question the probative value of the evidence actually relied upon by the DIMD  or the reasonableness and objectivity of the determination based on that  evidence. A lack of consistency  in the selection of beginning or ending points in an end-point to end-point  comparison does not in itself gives  rise to an inconsistency with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.4. On the facts of this case, the European Union did not demonstrate that  the DIMD acted inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.4 by failing to systematically  compare data for 2011 with data for 2008 for all economic indicators. The European  Union also did not demonstrate that DIMD failed to base its evaluation  on an objective examination of the evidence concerning the domestic industry's  profit/profitability during the POI,  that the DIMD assumed that the exceptional positive developments in the  domestic industry during 2009 could continue during 2010-2011 without more  explanation, and &ldquo;base[d] its conclusions on a comparison between these  two time periods&rdquo;, and that the  DIMD failed to consider two sets of facts and arguments relevant to the state  of the domestic industry that  were before it. Concerning the European Union's argument that the DIMD failed  to examine all relevant factors under Article 3.4, the Panel found that the  DIMD examined the return on investments, actual and potential effects on cash  flow, and the ability to raise capital or investments, but failed to examine  the magnitude of the margin of dumping. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Claims concerning causation</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The European Union claimed that the DIMD acted  inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1  and 3.5 by failing to properly establish a causal link between the  dumped imports and the alleged injury, and by failing to conduct a proper non-attribution  analysis of factors other than the dumped imports that were known to the DIMD  and that were injuring the domestic industry at the same time as dumped imports. The European Union further argues  that, insofar as the DIMD relied on its price suppression analysis in  determining causation, that inadequate analysis also undermined the causation  analysis. <br>
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>The  Panel found that the  DIMD acted inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.5 insofar as it relied  on price suppression in its causation determination. However, the Panel found that the European Union did not establish that the  causation determination of the DIMD was one that a reasonable and objective  investigating authority could not have reached on the basis of the evidence and  arguments before it. Concerning the  DIMD's non-attribution analysis, the Panel found that the European Union  did not establish that the DIMD's non-attribution analysis of the termination of the licence agreement and  the competition from GAZ was inconsistent with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.5.&nbsp; The  Panel found, however, that by failing to address PCA's argument regarding the  possible cause of Sollers' low capacity utilisation during the period of  consideration<strong> </strong>in its non&#8209;attribution  analysis, the DIMD acted inconsistently with Articles&nbsp;3.1 and 3.5.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Claims concerning the confidential treatment  of information</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The  European Union claimed that confidential treatment by the DIMD of  certain information submitted by interested parties was inconsistent with Articles&nbsp;6.5  and 6.5.1 because, with respect to each item of information in question, one or  more of the following occurred:<br>
&nbsp;              </li>
              <ul>
                            <li>the DIMD failed to require a showing of good  cause for confidential treatment;<br>
&nbsp;                            </li>
                            <li>the DIMD did not assess whether the cause shown  was sufficient to warrant the confidential treatment; <br>
&nbsp;                            </li>
                            <li>there was no &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo; summary of  the confidential information submitted; or <br>
&nbsp;                            </li>
                            <li>no explanation of why a summary was not possible  was provided. <br>
&nbsp;                            </li>
              </ul>
              <li>The Panel found that in respect of certain  items of information treated as confidential by the DIMD at issue in this  dispute, the European Union demonstrated that the submitters of that  information did not show good cause for confidential treatment. On that basis,  in respect of all the information at issue, treated as confidential by the  DIMD, the DIMD did not act  consistently with Article&nbsp;6.5. &nbsp;The Panel did not find it necessary to  address the claims of the European Union under Article&nbsp;6.5.1 to resolve  this dispute. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Claims concerning disclosure of essential  facts</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The European Union claimed a violation of  Article 6.9 on the basis that the DIMD failed to inform interested parties of  essential facts under consideration concerning all aspects of the decision to  impose the definitive measure. The  Panel found that the DIMD did not act inconsistently with Article 6.9 by not  informing all interested parties of certain information, but acted  inconsistently with Article 6.9 by failing to inform all interested parties of  the rest of the information at issue.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
      </div>

    	    <p><strong>Definition of  domestic industry:</strong></p>
    	    <p>Russia argued that  the Panel erred in its interpretation and application of Articles 3.1 and 4.1  of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because an injury determination would be  inconsistent with Article 3.1 if an investigating authority were to rely on  deficient information provided by domestic producers. To Russia, producers that  provided deficient information cannot be included in the definition of domestic  industry under Article 4.1. The Appellate Body did not consider that Article  3.1 allows investigating authorities to leave domestic producers of the like  product out of the definition of domestic industry because of alleged  deficiencies in the information submitted by those producers. The Anti-Dumping  Agreement sets out tools to address the inaccuracy and incompleteness of  information. To the Appellate Body, the Panel's interpretation does not create  a conflict between the obligations in Article 3.1 and Article 4.1. The  Appellate Body thus upheld the Panel's finding that the DIMD acted  inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 4.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement in its  definition of &ldquo;domestic industry&rdquo;.</p>
    	    <p><strong>Price  suppression</strong></p>
    	    <p>In relation to  Russia's challenge to the Panel's findings that the DIMD acted inconsistently  with Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement by failing to take into  account the impact of the financial crisis in determining the rate of return  used to construct the target domestic price, the Appellate Body noted that, as  acknowledged by the DIMD, the performance of the domestic industry in 2009 was  positively affected by the financial crisis. The DIMD, however, did not explain  why these extraordinary conditions were not relevant to its counterfactual  analysis. Using a higher rate of return for the domestic industry in this counterfactual  analysis would lead to a higher probability of finding price suppression. The  Appellate Body considered that an investigating authority cannot disregard  evidence regarding any particular element that calls into question the  explanatory force of dumped imports for significant price suppression. In  response to Russia's argument that the Panel incorporated, in its price  suppression analysis, the consideration of &ldquo;all known factors&rdquo;  causing injury within the meaning of Article 3.5, the Appellate Body explained  that the inquiries under both provisions have distinct focuses. Article 3.5  focuses on the causal relationship between dumped imports and injury to the  domestic industry. In contrast, Article 3.2 focuses on the relationship between  dumped imports and domestic prices. The Appellate Body thus upheld the Panel's  finding at issue.</p>
    	    <p>In relation to the  European Union's claims under Article 11 of the DSU, the Appellate Body faulted  the Panel under this provision. This was because the Panel's findings  concerning the DIMD's methodology, the long-term price trends, and the degree  of price suppression were not coherent and consistent with the Panel's earlier  finding that the manner in which the DIMD used the 2009 rate of return to  determine the target domestic price was WTO inconsistent.</p>
    	    <p>In relation to the  European Union's challenge under Articles 3.1 and 3.2 concerning the question  of whether the domestic market could absorb further price increases, the  Appellate Body considered that an investigating authority must ensure that its  price suppression methodology assesses price increases &ldquo;which otherwise  would have occurred&rdquo; in the absence of dumped imports. While the Appellate  Body found that the Panel did not err in its interpretation, it faulted the  Panel for having itself undertaken the assessment of relevant evidence on the  DIMD's investigation record. Having reversed the Panel's finding at issue, the  Appellate Body completed the analysis and found that the DIMD acted  inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.2 by failing to examine evidence  relevant to whether the market would accept additional domestic price  increases.</p>
    	    <p><strong>Confidential  investigation report</strong></p>
    	    <p>The European Union  claimed that the Panel acted inconsistently with Article 11 of the DSU and  Article 17.6 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement by basing its evaluation of the  European Union's claims concerning certain injury factors on the confidential  investigation report without assessing whether that document formed part of the  DIMD's investigation record. The Appellate Body considered that, when faced  with a claim that a report, or parts of it, on the basis of which an  anti-dumping measure was imposed, did not form part of the investigation  record, a panel has to take certain steps to assess objectively and assure  itself of the validity of such report, or its parts, and whether it formed part  of the contemporaneous written record of the investigation. According to the  Appellate Body, the Panel did not seek to assure itself that the relevant parts  of the confidential investigation report formed part of the investigation  record at the time the determination to impose the anti-dumping measure was  made. The Appellate Body thus found that the Panel acted inconsistently with  Article 11 of the DSU and Article 17.6 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.</p>
    	    <p><strong>Related dealer</strong></p>
    	    <p>In relation to the  European Union's challenge to the Panel's finding that Article 3.4 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement does not generally require an investigating authority to  consider the inventories of a dealer related to a domestic producer, but not  itself part of the domestic industry, the Appellate Body considered that, in  certain circumstances, evidence concerning a related dealer may be pertinent,  in a particular case, to the evaluation of the state of the domestic industry.  To the Appellate Body, the degree of proximity in the relationship between  different entities is not dispositive of whether evidence relating to the  inventory of a related dealer is pertinent to the evaluation of  &ldquo;inventories&rdquo; for purposes of the injury analysis. The Appellate Body  upheld the Panel's finding that the European Union had not established that the  DIMD acted inconsistently with Articles 3.1 and 3.4 by not considering the  inventories data of the related dealer at issue in the investigation report.</p>
    	    <p><strong>Essential facts</strong></p>
    	    <p>In relation to  Russia's appeal concerning the relationship between Articles 6.5 and 6.9 of the  Anti-Dumping Agreement, the Appellate Body found that the inquiry under Article  6.9 is separate and distinct from the assessment under Article 6.5. To the  Appellate Body, regardless of whether essential facts were properly treated as  confidential under Article 6.5, a panel must examine whether any disclosure  made &mdash; including those made through non-confidential summaries under Article  6.5.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement &mdash; meets the legal standard under Article  6.9. The Appellate Body thus faulted the Panel for having considered that,  where essential facts are not properly treated as confidential in accordance  with Article 6.5, this automatically leads to an inconsistency with Article  6.9. The Appellate Body completed the analysis and found that the DIMD acted  inconsistently with Article 6.9 by failing to disclose the essential facts in  items (d) and (f) to (o) of Table 12 in paragraph 7.278 of the Panel Report.<u></u></p>
            In relation to the European Union's appeal concerning  the disclosure of methodologies, the Appellate Body found that certain type of  methodologies may be essential facts under Article 6.9 of the Anti-Dumping  Agreement, namely those that are necessary for participants to understand the  basis of the investigating authority's decision and to defend their interests.  With respect to sources of information, the Appellate Body found that, in  certain circumstances, knowledge of the data itself may not be sufficient to  enable an interested party to properly defend itself, unless that party is also  informed of the source of such data and how it was used by the investigating  authority. In certain circumstances, the source of the data may be an essential  fact under Article 6.9. The Appellate Body thus found that the Panel erred in  its interpretation and application of Article 6.9 by considering that  methodologies and sources of information cannot qualify as essential facts.          </div>
