        <h3>Consultations</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext"><strong>Complaint by Ukraine.  </strong></p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> On 21 October 2015, Ukraine requested consultations  with the Russian Federation concerning certain measures imposed by the Russian  Federation on the importation of railway equipment and parts thereof.</p>
        <p class="paranormaltext"> Ukraine claims that the measures are inconsistent with:</p>
        <ul class="paranormaltext">
          <li class="paranormaltext">Articles I:1, III:4, X:3(a), XI:1 and XIII:1 of  the GATT 1994; and<br>
&nbsp;          </li>
          <li class="paranormaltext">Articles 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.2.1,  5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.2.5 and 5.2.6 of the TBT Agreement.</li>

      <p class="paranormaltext">&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Panel and Appellate Body proceedings</h3>
        <p class="paranormaltext">On 10  November 2016, Ukraine requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting  on 23&nbsp;November&nbsp;2016, the DSB deferred the establishment of a panel.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">At its meeting on 16 December 2016, the DSB established a panel. Canada, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and the United States reserved their third-party rights. Following agreement of the parties, the panel was composed on 2 March 2017.</p>
      <p class="paranormaltext">On 18 July 2017, the Chair of the panel informed the  DSB that the panel expected to issue its final report to the parties in April  2018, in accordance with the timetable adopted after consultation with the  parties. On 24 April 2018, the  Chair of the panel informed the DSB that, due to the complex procedural and  factual nature of the dispute, and  after consultations with the parties, the panel expected to issue its final  report to the parties in May 2018. The Chair also informed the DSB that the report would be  available to the public once it was circulated to the Members in all three  official languages, and that the date of circulation depends on completion of  translation.</p>
            <p class="paranormaltext" id="bkmk499r"><a  name="bkmk499r"></a>On 30 July 2018, the panel report was circulated to Members. </p>

    	    <p align="left">Ukraine  challenged Russia's application of its conformity assessment procedures for  railway products to suppliers from Ukraine of rolling stock, railroad switches  and other railroad equipment (railway products).</p>
            <p align="left">More  specifically, Ukraine challenged three categories of measures. The first category  concerns (a) 14 instructions through which Russia's certification body  suspended certificates of conformity issued to suppliers of Ukrainian railway  products before the entry into force of the CU (suspension instructions), due  to the (alleged) impossibility of carrying out the required yearly inspection  of the suppliers in Ukraine given the security situation there; and (b) three  decisions through which Russia's certification body rejected applications for  new certificates submitted by suppliers of Ukrainian railway products pursuant  to CU Technical Regulations 001/2011 and 003/2011 (rejection decisions), due to  the (alleged) impossibility to carry out inspections in Ukraine or incomplete  applications. </p>
            <p align="left">Another  measure is the requirement applied by certain Russian authorities not to  recognize the validity of certificates of conformity issued by other CU  countries pursuant to CU Technical Regulation 001/2011 for railway products  produced in a non-CU country (non-recognition requirement). Because of this requirement,  Ukrainian suppliers in possession of valid certificates of conformity issued in  Belarus or Kazakhstan for railway products produced in Ukraine were not allowed  by Russia to export their products to Russia using the certificates issued in  those other CU countries. </p>
            <p align="left">The final  measure is the alleged systematic prevention of imports of Ukrainian railway  products into Russia by way of (a) suspending valid certificates of conformity  held by suppliers of Ukrainian railway products, (b) rejecting applications for  new certificates submitted by suppliers of Ukrainian railway products, and (c)  not recognizing the validity in Russia of certificates issued by other CU  countries if the certificates covered products not produced in a CU country.</p>
            <p align="left">Ukraine raised  claims against these measures under different provisions of the Agreement on  Technical Barriers to Trade and the GATT 1994.</p>
            <p align="left">Regarding the  suspension instructions, the panel found that: </p>
            <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
              <li>Ukraine did not establish that,  contrary to Article 5.1.1 of the TBT Agreement, Russia applied its conformity  assessment procedure in a manner that granted Ukrainian suppliers of railway  products access under conditions less favourable than those granted to Russian  and European suppliers of like railway products, in a comparable situation. The  Panel reached this conclusion based on its determination that due to the risks  to the life and health of Russian inspectors arising from the security  situation in Ukraine, the situation in Ukraine was not comparable to that in other  exporting countries and that Russia was therefore justified in not sending its  inspectors there to carry out inspections;</li>
              <li>Ukraine did not establish that,  contrary to Article 5.1.2 of the TBT Agreement, Russia applied its conformity  assessment procedure more strictly than necessary to give Russia adequate  confidence that Ukrainian railway products conformed with the relevant  technical regulations. More specifically, the Panel concluded that to obtain adequate  confidence that the Ukrainian railway products (whose certificates had been  suspended) conformed with the relevant substantive technical requirements,  Russian inspectors had to inspect the relevant facilities and products in  Ukraine. However, due to the security situation in Ukraine, Russian inspectors  were justified in not conducting the required inspections. Ukraine did not  demonstrate that there were less trade restrictive manners of applying Russia's  conformity assessment procedure that would make an equivalent contribution to  ensuring that suppliers of Ukrainian railway products conformed with the  relevant technical regulations and were reasonably available to Russia (such as  off-site inspections); </li>
              <li>Ukraine established, in respect of 13  of the 14 suspension instructions at issue, that Russia's certification body  did not transmit the results of the assessment in a precise and complete manner  to the applicant, contrary to the third obligation in Article 5.2.2 of the TBT  Agreement. However, Ukraine did not establish that this was also the case for the  other suspension instruction at issue, as that instruction provided information  on the reasons for the failure to conduct the relevant inspections of the  products at issue at the facilities of the relevant Ukrainian supplier.</li>
            </ol>
            <p align="left">Regarding the  rejection decisions, the Panel found that: </p>
            <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
              <li>Ukraine did not establish that,  contrary to Article 5.1.1 of the TBT Agreement, Russia applied its conformity  assessment procedure in a manner that granted suppliers of Ukrainian railway  products access under conditions less favourable than those granted to  suppliers of like Russian and European railway products, in a comparable  situation. More specifically, the Panel determined that, regarding the two  rejections decisions issued pursuant to CU Technical Regulation 001/2011, due  to the risks to the life and health of Russian inspectors arising from the  security situation in Ukraine, the situation in Ukraine was not comparable to  that in other exporting countries and that Russia was therefore justified in  rejecting the relevant applications for certificates of conformity. Regarding  the rejection decision issued due to incomplete applications submitted by the  Ukrainian supplier, the Panel determined that Ukraine did not establish that  Russia granted Ukrainian suppliers of railway products less favourable access  conditions to the procedure, because Russia's certification body could not  accept and process incomplete applications;</li>
              <li>Ukraine established that, contrary to  Article 5.1.2 of the TBT Agreement and regarding one of the rejection decisions  issued pursuant to CU Technical Regulation 001/2011, Russia applied its  conformity assessment procedure more strictly than necessary to give Russia  adequate confidence that Ukrainian railway products conformed with the relevant  technical regulations. More specifically, the Panel determined, in respect of  three of the four applications rejected through that particular rejection  decision, that it was possible for Russia's certification body to inspect the  relevant railway products outside Ukraine by testing samples, and that  therefore there was a less strict manner of applying Russia's conformity  assessment procedure that was also reasonably available to Russia;</li>
              <li>Ukraine did not establish that,  contrary to Article 5.1.2 of the TBT Agreement and regarding the other  application rejected through the previously mentioned rejection decision as  well as the other rejection decision issued pursuant to CU Technical Regulation  001/2011 and also the rejection decision issued pursuant to CU Technical  Regulation 003/2011, Russia applied its conformity assessment procedure more  strictly than necessary to give Russia adequate confidence that Ukrainian  railway products conformed with the relevant technical regulations. More specifically,  the Panel concluded, regarding the rejection decisions issued pursuant to CU  Technical Regulation 001/2011, that to obtain adequate confidence that the  Ukrainian railway products conformed with the relevant substantive technical  requirements, Russian inspectors had to test the products in Ukraine. However,  due to the security situation in Ukraine, Russian inspectors were justified in  not conducting the required tests there. Regarding the rejection decision  issued pursuant to CU Technical Regulation 003/2011, the Panel concluded that  under the applicable procedures Russia's certification body had to reject  incomplete applications. Therefore, Ukraine did not demonstrate that there were  less trade-restrictive manners of applying Russia's conformity assessment  procedure that would make an equivalent contribution to ensuring that suppliers  of Ukrainian railway products conformed with the relevant technical regulations  and were reasonably available to Russia (such as off-site testing of samples or  the processing of incomplete applications);</li>
              <li>Ukraine did not establish that,  contrary to the second obligation in Article 5.2.2 of the TBT Agreement and  regarding the three rejection decisions, Russia's certification body did not  promptly examine the completeness of the documentation and inform the applicant  in a precise and complete manner of all deficiencies in the applications. More  specifically, the Panel found that through the rejection decisions issued  pursuant to CU Technical Regulation 001/2011, Russia's certification body  informed the applicants of the impossibility to conduct testing of samples,  which it had to do as soon as possible as a consequence of the third obligation  of Article 5.2.2, even if it required additional time to examine the  completeness of the applications. Moreover, through the rejection decision  issued pursuant to CU Technical Regulation 003/2011, Russia's certification  body informed the applicant that the applications did not contain the required  documents, thus informing the applicant of all deficiencies in its applications  in a precise and complete manner;</li>
              <li>Ukraine established that, contrary to  the third obligation in Article 5.2.2 of the TBT Agreement and in respect of  the two rejection decisions issued pursuant to CU Technical Regulation  001/2011, Russia's certification body did not transmit the results of the  assessment in a precise and complete manner to the applicants. More  specifically, the Panel found that through the relevant communications,  Russia's certification body did not provide the applicants precise and complete  information as to why the applications were rejected; and </li>
              <li>Ukraine did not establish that,  contrary to the third obligation in Article 5.2.2 of the TBT Agreement and in  respect of the rejection decision issued pursuant to CU Technical Regulation  003/2011, Russia's certification body did not transmit the results of the  assessment in a precise and complete manner to the applicant. More  specifically, the Panel found that this rejection decision was outside the  scope of the third obligation in Article 5.2.2 because it did not transmit the  result of any part of the conformity assessment procedure.</li>
            </ol>
            <p align="left">Regarding the  non-recognition requirement, the Panel found that: </p>
            <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
              <li>Ukraine did not establish that the  non-recognition requirement falls within the scope of Article 2.1 of the TBT  Agreement, because the non-recognition requirement concerns conformity  assessment, which is distinct from the substantive technical requirements with  which a conformity assessment procedure seeks to verify compliance; </li>
              <li>Ukraine established that, contrary to  Article I:1 of the GATT 1994, through the non-recognition requirement Russia  discriminated between Ukrainian railway products and like railway products from  other countries. More specifically, the Panel found that Russian authorities  did not recognize the validity in Russia of certificates of conformity issued  for Ukrainian railway products by certification bodies in other CU countries,  whereas it did recognize the validity of certificates of conformity issued by  CU certification bodies for like railway products produced in other CU  countries; and </li>
              <li>Ukraine established that, contrary to  Article III:4 of the GATT 1994, through the non-recognition requirement Russia  discriminated between Ukrainian railway products and like domestic railway  products. More specifically, the Panel found that Russian authorities did not  recognize the validity in Russia of certificates of conformity issued for  Ukrainian railway products by certification bodies in other CU countries while  recognizing the validity of certificates of conformity issued by CU  certification bodies for like railway products produced in Russia.</li>
            </ol>
            <p align="left">The Panel made  no findings regarding Ukraine's claims under Articles 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 of the  TBT Agreement because they concerned aspects of the non-recognition requirement  that the Panel found were not properly before the Panel. The alleged  requirement that the Panel found to be outside its terms of reference is that  Russian authorities would only recognize as valid in Russia CU certificates of  conformity issued to applicants registered in the same place where the  certification body to which the application was submitted is located. </p>
            <p align="left">The Panel  exercised judicial economy in respect of Ukraine's claims of inconsistency with  Article X:3(a) of the GATT 1994.</p>
            <p align="left">Regarding the  alleged systematic prevention by Russia of imports of Ukrainian railway  products, the Panel found that Ukraine had not established its claims of  inconsistency with Russia's non-discrimination obligations (Articles I:1 and  XIII:1 of the GATT 1994) and Russia's obligation not to impose restrictions on  international trade (Article XI:1 of the GATT 1994), because Ukraine had not  demonstrated the existence of the alleged systematic prevention of imports of  Ukrainian railway products into Russia.</p>
          </div>

<p class="paranormaltext">On 27 August  2018, Ukraine notified the DSB of its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body  certain issues of law and legal interpretations in the panel  report  and filed a  Notice of Appeal and an appellant's submission. On 3 September 2018, the Russian  Federation notified  the DSB of its decision to cross-appeal and filed a  notice of other appeal and an other  appellant's submission.</p>
<p class="paranormaltext">On 24 October 2018, upon expiry of the 60-day period  provided for in Article 17.5 of the DSU, the Appellate Body informed the DSB  that it would not be able to circulate the Appellate Body report in this appeal  by the end of the 60-day period, nor within the 90-day time-frame provided for  in Article&nbsp;17.5 of the DSU. The Appellate Body referred to the size of the  panel record and the complexity of issued that had been appealed. The Appellate  Body also noted the backlog of appeals pending with the Appellate Body at that  time, and the overlap in the composition of all divisions resulting in part  from the reduced number of Appellate Body members. The  Appellate Body indicated that it would not be possible for the Division to  focus on the consideration of this appeal for some time. Proceedings gathered pace in June&nbsp;2019. The oral hearing in this appeal was held on 17  and 18&nbsp;September&nbsp;2019. On 9&nbsp;December 2019, the Chair of the Appellate&nbsp;Body  informed the Chair of the DSB that the Report in this appeal would be  circulated no later than 4&nbsp;February 2020.</p>

            <p><strong>Russia's claims regarding the  Panel's preliminary ruling under Article&nbsp;6.2 of the DSU</strong></p>
            <p>The Appellate Body rejected Russia's  claim that the Panel erred in its preliminary ruling. In particular, the  Appellate Body held that the Panel properly analysed the linkages between the  measures challenged by Ukraine and the WTO provisions allegedly infringed based  on the text of the panel request. Moreover, the Appellate Body agreed with the  Panel that Ukraine had properly identified the measures at issue in its Panel  Request. </p>
            <p><strong>Ukraine's claims under Article  5.1.1 of the TBT Agreement (&ldquo;comparable situation&rdquo;)</strong></p>
            <p>The Appellate Body agreed with the  Panel that the assessment of whether access is granted under conditions no less  favourable &ldquo;in a comparable situation&rdquo; within the meaning of Article  5.1.1 of the TBT&nbsp;Agreement should focus on factors having a bearing on the  conditions for granting access to conformity assessment in that specific case  and the ability of the regulating Member to ensure compliance with the  requirements in the underlying technical regulation or standard. At the same  time, the Appellate Body found that, in examining factors relevant for  establishing the existence of a &ldquo;comparable situation&rdquo; in the  particular circumstances of this case, the Panel did not focus sufficiently on  aspects specific to the suppliers who were claimed to have been granted access  under less favourable conditions or to the location of the suppliers'  facilities and instead relied on information concerning the security situation  in Ukraine generally. Accordingly, the Appellate Body reversed the Panel's  application of Article 5.1.1 to the facts of the present case.</p>
            <p><strong>Ukraine's claims under Article  5.1.2 of the TBT Agreement (necessity test)</strong></p>
            <p>The Appellate Body found that the  Panel erred in its application of the burden of proof under Article 5.1.2 of  the TBT&nbsp;Agreement in requiring Ukraine to provide evidence that the  requirements of one specific provision under Russian law were fulfilled, for purposes  of demonstrating that its proposed less trade restrictive alternative measure  was reasonably available. In particular, the Appellate Body disagreed with the  Panel that it was for Ukraine to establish that there had not been any non-conformities  or consumer complaints relating to the products at issue. </p>
            <p><strong>Ukraine's claims regarding the  existence of systematic import prevention under Article&nbsp;11 of the DSU</strong></p>
            <p>The Appellate Body found that the  Panel properly considered whether the individual components of the alleged  unwritten measure formed part of a common plan to prevent imports of Ukrainian  products into Russia. The Appellate Body therefore rejected Ukraine's  allegation that the Panel had failed to make an objective assessment of the  matter in finding that Ukraine had failed to demonstrate that Russia  systematically prevented the importation of Ukrainian railway products into  Russia.</p>
            <p><strong>Russia's claims under Article 11  of the DSU</strong></p>
    	    Russia  raised several claims under Article 11 of the DSU in relation to Panel's  findings concerning the alleged requirement that Russia's authorities must not  recognize certificates issued in other Eurasian Economic Union countries if the  certified railway products were not produced in the Eurasian Economic Union  (Russia's third measure). The Appellate Body rejected these claims. In  particular, the Appellate Body held that the third measure was properly within  the Panel's terms of reference for the same reasons that the Appellate Body had  provided in relation to Russia's claim concerning the Panel's preliminary  ruling. Moreover, the Appellate Body found no error in the Panel's assessment  of whether the third measure existed. The Appellate Body also disagreed with  Russia that the Panel had erred by making findings with respect to a measure it  had previously found to be not within its terms of reference.

    <p>At its meeting on 28 February and 5 March 2020, the DSB adopted  the Appellate Body report and panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body  report.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Implementation of adopted reports</h3>
    <p>On 19 March 2020, the Russian Federation requested the  Chair of the DSB to circulate to Members a communication indicating that it had  revoked certain requirements for the recognition of conformity assessment  procedures and informed relevant Ukrainian producers of requirements they  should comply with to obtain a certificate of conformity. The Russian Federation observed that by taking these actions, it considered to  have fully implemented the DSB's rulings and recommendations in this dispute.  On 23 March 2020, Ukraine requested the Chair of the DSB to circulate a  communication indicating that it respectfully asked the DSB to request the  Russian Federation to elaborate on the requirements that Ukrainian producers  have to comply with in order to obtain the certificates of conformity, in  particular, those related to safety of the employees of the certification body.  Ukraine also observed that it believed that the issue of the implementation of  the DSB's rulings and recommendations could be considered only after reviewing  and analysing the requested information. </p>
